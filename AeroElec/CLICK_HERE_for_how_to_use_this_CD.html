<li>The AeroElectric Connection E-Book<p>
<a href=AeroElectric_Connection_E-Book>Click here</a> to access the E-Book version
of The AeroElectric Connection, Revision 12A. Note that work product in this

<li>AeroElectric.com Website<p>
<a href=AeroElectric.Com_Website/index.html>Click here </a> to browse our website
directly from this CD. Links that are not on the CD will not work unless
you are logged onto the Internet . . . but everything else should come
up lightning quick . . .<FONT COLOR=RED>KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS CD REPRESENTS
THE WEBSITE CONFIGURATION THE DAY IT WAS COMPILED. THE WEBSITE IS CONSTANTLY
CHANGING. THIS CD IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR GETTING ON THE 'NET TO ACCESS THE
LATEST.</FONT><p>

<li>AutoCAD Drawings<p>
<a href=AutoCAD_Drawings/>Click here</a> for a directory of selected works
in progress taken from my library of AutoCAD drawings and wirebooks. This
directory also contains my symbol library used to generate the drawings.
You're free to use these drawings as needed to craft a very nice wirebook
for your own project. By picking and choosing from these drawings, 
you'll need to do very little editing to make the drawing fit your project. 
This same directory contains copies of the power distribution diagrams
from Appendix Z of the AeroElectric Connection in AutoCAD .dwg files.<p>

<li>A number of folks over the years have asked for recommended study
materials in electronics. Of course, there are thousands of texts out there.
I have several dozens in my library. It's hard to recommend any single text
to go out and buy. Instead, how about a comprehensive look at the basics of
electronics for no extra charge to be included on this CD?  <a href="Navy_Electronics_Course">
Click here for a directory </a> on this CD called Navy_Electronics_Course. In this directory you will find 24
.pdf files . . . each comprising one of 24 modules in an electronics course. I
taught at Great Lakes Naval Training Base for a time and was impressed with
the quality of Navy technical education. These documents came right out of that
same environment. Happy learning . . .<p>

<li>Here is an excellent illustrated
course in <a href="Course_in_DC_Electronics/DC.pdf">DC Electronics</a> found on the 'net.
Whether you're starting from scratch or need a refresher, take a look at this
nice piece of work . . .<p>

<li>Selected FAA Publications<P>
<A href="AeroElectric.Com_Website/Reference_Docs/FAA/AC43.13-1B_Change1.pdf">Click here </a>for a .pdf copy
AC43.13-1B: "ACCEPTABLE METHODS, TECHNIQUES, AND PRACTICES. AIRCRAFT INSPECTION
AND REPAIR", the most widely quoted reference
on aircraft maintenance published by the FAA. I participated in an EAA
review committee that submitted about 100 suggestions for improvement to 
the current document. Many of the improvements were incorporated but it's 
still full of holes and junk science . . . at least in the electrical 
systems chapters. I rather think the hammer-n-tongs chapters are pretty good.<P>

<A A href="AeroElectric.Com_Website/Reference_Docs/FAA/AC20-27f.pdf">Click here</a> for a copy
of AC20-27F: "CERTIFICATION AND OPERATION OF AMATEUR-BUILT AIRCRAFT".<P>

<li><A href=FARS/>Click here </a> for selected FAR's downloaded from the FAA's website. 
Again, these documents are offered as a reference only for the FAA's approach 
to doing things. When it comes to configuring and fabricating your own 
airplane, don't be afraid to adopt new ideas and techniques of your own or 
suggested by others if they are based on good science. Stay plugged into 
the list-server community for your airplane and to the AeroElectric List 
on matronics.com as the best sources of light for the path of good science 
and practical arts of building the world's finest airplanes.<p>

Fly comfortably . . .<p>
