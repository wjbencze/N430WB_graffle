         Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 13

1. Applicability. Contrary provisions of the Civil Air Regulations
regarding certification notwithstanding,1 this regulation shall provide the
basis for approval by the Administrator of modifications of individual
Douglas DC-3 and Lockheed L-18 airplanes subsequent to the effective date of
this regulation.

NOTE 1 It is not intended to waive compliance with such airworthiness
requirements as are included in the operating parts of the Civil Air
Regulations for specific types of operation.

2. General modifications. Except as modified in sections 3 and 4 of this
regulation, an applicant for approval of modifications to a DC-3 or L-18
airplane which result in changes in design or in changes to approved
limitations shall show that the modifications were accomplished in accordance
with the rules of either Part 4a or Part 4b in effect on September 1, 1953,
which are applicable to the modification being made: Provided, That an
applicant may elect to accomplish a modification in accordance with the rules
of Part 4b in effect on the date of application for the modification in lieu
of Part 4a or Part 4b as in effect on September 1, 1953: And provided
further, That each specific modification must be accomplished in accordance
with all of the provisions contained in the elected rules relating to the
particular modification.
3. Specific conditions for approval. An applicant for any approval of the
following specific changes shall comply with section 2 of this regulation as
modified by the applicable provisions of this section.
(a) Increase in take-off power limitation--1,200 to 1,350 horsepower. The
engine take-off power limitation for the airplane may be increased to more
than 1,200 horsepower but not to more than 1,350 horsepower per engine if the
increase in power does not adversely affect the flight characteristics of the
airplane.
(b) Increase in take-off power limitation to more than 1,350 horsepower.
The engine take-off power limitation for the airplane may be increased to
more than 1,350 horsepower per engine if compliance is shown with the flight
characteristics and ground handling requirements of Part 4b.
(c) Installation of engines of not more than 1,830 cubic inches
displacement and not having a certificated take-off rating of more than 1,350
horsepower. Engines of not more than 1,830 cubic inches displacement and not
having a certificated take-off rating of more than 1,350 horsepower which
necessitate a major modification of redesign of the engine installation may
be installed, if the engine fire prevention and fire protection are
equivalent to that on the prior engine installation.
(d) Installation of engines of more than 1,830 cubic inches displacement or
having certificated take-off rating of more than 1,350 horsepower. Engines of
more than 1,830 cubic inches displacement or having certificated take-off
rating of more than 1,350 horsepower may be installed if compliance is shown
with the engine installation requirements of Part 4b: Provided, That where
literal compliance with the engine installation requirements of Part 4b is
extremely difficult to accomplish and would not contribute materially to the
objective sought, and the Administrator finds that the experience with the
DC-3 or L-18 airplanes justifies it, he is authorized to accept such measures
of compliance as he finds will effectively accomplish the basic objective.
4. Establishment of new maximum certificated weights. An applicant for
approval of new maximum certificated weights shall apply for an amendment of
the airworthiness certificate of the airplane and shall show that the weights
sought have been established, and the appropriate manual material obtained,
as provided in this section.

Note: Transport category performance requirements result in the
establishment of maximum certificated weights for various altitudes.

(a) Weights-25,200 to 26,900 for the DC-3 and 18,500 to 19,500 for the L-
18. New maximum certificated weights of more than 25,200 but not more than
26,900 pounds for DC-3 and more than 18,500 but not more than 19,500 pounds
for L-18 airplanes may be established in accordance with the transport
category performance requirements of either Part 4a or Part 4b, if the
airplane at the new maximum weights can meet the structural requirements of
the elected part.
(b) Weights of more than 26,900 for the DC-3 and 19,500 for the L-18. New
maximum certificated weights of more than 26,900 pounds for DC-3 and 19,500
pounds for L-18 airplanes shall be established in accordance with the
structural performance, flight characteristics, and ground handling
requirements of Part 4b: Provided,  That where literal compliance with the
structural requirements of Part 4b is extremely difficult to accomplish and
would not contribute materially to the objective sought, and the
Administrator finds that the experience with the DC-3 or L-18 airplanes
justifies it, he is authorized to accept such measures of compliance as he
finds will effectively accomplish the basic objective.
(c) Airplane flight manual-performance operating information. An approved
airplane flight manual shall be provided for each DC-3 and L-18 airplane
which has had new maximum certificated weights established under this
section. The airplane flight manual shall contain the applicable performance
information prescribed in that part of the regulations under which the new
certificated weights were established and such additional information as may
be necessary to enable the application of the take-off, en route, and landing
limitations prescribed for transport category airplanes in the operating
parts of the Civil Air Regulations.
(d) Performance operating limitations. Each airplane for which new maximum
certificated weights are established in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b)
of this section shall be considered a transport category airplane for the
purpose of complying with the performance operating limitations applicable to
the operations in which it is utilized.
5. Reference. Unless otherwise provided, all references in this regulation
to Part 4a and Part 4b are those parts of the Civil Air Regulations in effect
on September 1, 1953.
This regulation supersedes Special Civil Air Regulation SR-398 and shall
remain effective until superseded or rescinded by the Board.

FR 8318, Feb. 18, 1998, Amdt. 25-94, 63 FR 8848, Feb. 23, 1998]






Sec. 25.107  Takeoff speeds.

(a) V1 must be established in relation to VEF as follows:
(1) VEF is the calibrated airspeed at which the critical engine is assumed
to fail. VEF must be selected by the applicant, but may not be less than VMCG,
determined under Sec. 25.149(e).
(2) V1, in terms of calibrated airspeed, is selected by the applicant;
however, V1 may not be less than VEF plus the speed gained with critical
engine inoperative during the time interval between the instant at which the
critical engine is failed, and the instant at which the pilot recognizes and
reacts to the engine failure, as indicated by the pilot's initiation of the
first action (e.g., applying brakes, reducing thrust, deploying speed brakes)
to stop the airplane during accelerate-stop tests.
(b) V2MIN, in terms of calibrated airspeed, may not be less than--
(1) 1.2 VS for--
(i) Two-engine and three-engine turbopropeller and reciprocating engine
powered airplanes; and
(ii) Turbojet powered airplanes without provisions for obtaining a
significant reduction in the one-engine-inoperative power-on stalling speed;
(2) 1.15 VS for--
(i) Turbopropeller and reciprocating engine powered airplanes with more
than three engines; and
(ii) Turbojet powered airplanes with provisions for obtaining a significant
reduction in the one-engine-inoperative power-on stalling speed; and
(3) 1.10 times VMC established under Sec. 25.149.
(c) V2, in terms of calibrated airspeed, must be selected by the applicant
to provide at least the gradient of climb required by Sec. 25.121(b) but may
not be less than--
(1) V2MIN, and
(2) VR plus the speed increment attained (in accordance with Sec. 25.111
(c)(2)) before reaching a height of 35 feet above the takeoff surface.
(d) VMU is the calibrated airspeed at and above which the airplane can
safely lift off the ground, and continue the takeoff. VMU speeds must be
selected by the applicant throughout the range of thrust-to-weight ratios to
be certificated. These speeds may be established from free air data if these
data are verified by ground takeoff tests.
(e) VR, in terms of calibrated airspeed, must be selected in accordance
with the conditions of paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of this section:
(1) VR may not be less than--
(i) V1;
(ii) 105 percent of VMC;
(iii) The speed (determined in accordance with Sec. 25.111(c)(2)) that
allows reaching V2 before reaching a height of 35 feet above the takeoff
surface; or
(iv) A speed that, if the airplane is rotated at its maximum practicable
rate, will result in a VLOF of not less than 110 percent of VMU in the all-
engines-operating condition and not less than 105 percent of VMU determined
at the thrust-to-weight ratio corresponding to the one-engine-inoperative
condition.
(2) For any given set of conditions (such as weight, configuration, and
temperature), a single value of VR, obtained in accordance with this
paragraph, must be used to show compliance with both the one-engine-
inoperative and the all-engines-operating takeoff provisions.
(3) It must be shown that the one-engine-inoperative takeoff distance,
using a rotation speed of 5 knots less than VR established in accordance with
paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, does not exceed the corresponding
one-engine-inoperative takeoff distance using the established VR. The takeoff
distances must be determined in accordance with Sec. 25.113(a)(1).
(4) Reasonably expected variations in service from the established takeoff
procedures for the operation of the airplane (such as over-rotation of the
airplane and out-of-trim conditions) may not result in unsafe flight
characteristics or in marked increases in the scheduled takeoff distances
established in accordance with Sec. 25.113(a).
(f) VLOF is the calibrated airspeed at which the airplane first becomes
airborne.

Sec. 25.109  Accelerate-stop distance.

(a) The accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway is the greater of the
following distances:
(1) The sum of the distances necessary to--
(i) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start with all engines
operating to VEF for takeoff from a dry runway;
(ii) Allow the airplane to accelerate from VEF to the highest speed reached
during the rejected takeoff, assuming the critical engine fails at VEF and
the pilot takes the first action to reject the takeoff at the V1 for takeoff
from a dry runway; and
(iii) Come to a full stop on a dry runway from the speed reached as
prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; plus
(iv) A distance equivalent to 2 seconds at the V1 for takeoff from a dry
runway.
(2) The sum of the distances necessary to--
(i) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start with all engines
operating to the highest speed reached during the rejected takeoff, assuming
the pilot takes the first action to reject the takeoff at the V1 for takeoff
from a dry runway; and
(ii) With all engines still operating, come to a full stop on dry runway
from the speed reached as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;
plus
(iii) A distance equivalent to 2 seconds at the V1 for takeoff from a dry
runway.
(b) The accelerate-stop distance on a wet runway is the greater of the
following distances:
(1) The accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway determined in accordance
with paragraph (a) of this section; or
(2) The accelerate-stop distance determined in accordance with paragraph
(a) of this section, except that the runway is wet and the corresponding wet
runway values of VEF and V1 are used. In determining the wet runway
accelerate-stop distance, the stopping force from the wheel brakes may never
exceed:
(i) The wheel brakes stopping force determined in meeting the requirements
of Sec. 25.101(i) and paragraph (a) of this section; and
(ii) The force resulting from the wet runway braking coefficient of
friction determined in accordance with paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section,
as applicable, taking into account the distribution of the normal load
between braked and unbraked wheels at the most adverse center-of-gravity
position approved for takeoff.
(c) The wet runway braking coefficient of friction for a smooth wet runway
is defined as a curve of friction coefficient versus ground speed and must be
computed as follows:
(1) The maximum tire-to-ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction
is defined as:

             [ ...Illustration appears here... ]

Where--

Tire Pressure=maximum airplane operating tire pressure (psi);
micro-t/gMAX=maximum tire-to-ground braking coefficient;
V=airplane true ground speed (knots); and
Linear interpolation may be used for tire pressures other than those listed.

(2) The maximum tire-to-ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction
must be adjusted to take into account the efficiency of the anti-skid system
on a wet runway. Anti-skid system operation must be demonstrated by flight
testing on a smooth wet runway, and its efficiency must be determined. Unless
a specific anti-skid system efficiency is determined from a quantitative
analysis of the flight testing on a smooth wet runway, the maximum tire-to-
ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction determined in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section must be multiplied by the efficiency value associated
with the type of anti-skid system installed on the airplane:

                 Type of anti-    Efficiency
                  skid system       value

                On-Off                  0.30
                Quasi-Modulating        0.50
                Fully Modulating        0.80

(d) At the option of the applicant, a higher wet runway braking coefficient
of friction may be used for runway surfaces that have been grooved or treated
with a porous friction course material. For grooved and porous friction
course runways, the wet runway braking coefficient of friction is defined as
either:
(1) 70 percent of the dry runway braking coefficient of friction used to

(2) The wet runway braking coefficient defined in paragraph (c) of this
section, except that a specific anti-skid system efficiency, if determined,
is appropriate for a grooved or porous friction course wet runway, and the
maximum tire-to-ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction is defined
as:

Where--

Tire Pressure=maximum airplane operating tire pressure (psi);
micro-t/gMAX=maximum tire-to-ground braking coefficient;
V=airplane true ground speed (knots); and
Linear interpolation may be used for tire pressures other than those listed.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, means other
than wheel brakes may be used to determine the accelerate-stop distance if
that means--
(1) Is safe and reliable;
(2) Is used so that consistent results can be expected under normal
operating conditions; and
(3) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the airplane.
(f) The effects of available reverse thrust--
(1) Shall not be included as an additional means of deceleration when
determining the accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway; and
(2) May be included as an additional means of deceleration using
recommended reverse thrust procedures when determining the accelerate-stop
distance on a wet runway, provided the requirements of paragraph (e) of this
section are met.
(g) The landing gear must remain extended throughout the accelerate-stop
distance.
(h) If the accelerate-stop distance includes a stopway with surface
characteristics substantially different from those of the runway, the takeoff
data must include operational correction factors for the accelerate-stop
distance. The correction factors must account for the particular surface
characteristics of the stopway and the variations in these characteristics
with seasonal weather conditions (such as temperature, rain, snow, and ice)
within the established operational limits.
(i) A flight test demonstration of the maximum brake kinetic energy
accelerate-stop distance must be conducted with not more than 10 percent of
the allowable brake wear range remaining on each of the airplane wheel
brakes.

Sec. 25.111  Takeoff path.

(a) The takeoff path extends from a standing start to a point in the
takeoff at which the airplane is 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface, or at
which the transition from the takeoff to the en route configuration is
completed and a speed is reached at which compliance with Sec. 25.121(c) is
shown, whichever point is higher. In addition--
(1) The takeoff path must be based on the procedures prescribed in Sec.
25.101(f);
(2) The airplane must be accelerated on the ground to VEF, at which point
the critical engine must be made inoperative and remain inoperative for the
rest of the takeoff; and
(3) After reaching VEF, the airplane must be accelerated to V2.
(b) During the acceleration to speed V2, the nose gear may be raised off
the ground at a speed not less than VR. However, landing gear retraction may
not be begun until the airplane is airborne.
(c) During the takeoff path determination in accordance with paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this section--
(1) The slope of the airborne part of the takeoff path must be positive at
each point;
(2) The airplane must reach V2 before it is 35 feet above the takeoff
surface and must continue at a speed as close as practical to, but not less
than V2, until it is 400 feet above the takeoff surface;
(3) At each point along the takeoff path, starting at the point at which
the airplane reaches 400 feet above the takeoff surface, the available
gradient of climb may not be less than--
(i) 1.2 percent for two-engine airplanes;
(ii) 1.5 percent for three-engine airplanes; and
(iii) 1.7 percent for four-engine airplanes; and
(4) Except for gear retraction and propeller feathering, the airplane
configuration may not be changed, and no change in power or thrust that
requires action by the pilot may be made, until the airplane is 400 feet
above the takeoff surface.
(d) The takeoff path must be determined by a continuous demonstrated
takeoff or by synthesis from segments. If the takeoff path is determined by
the segmental method--
(1) The segments must be clearly defined and must be related to the
distinct changes in the configuration, power or thrust, and speed;
(2) The weight of the airplane, the configuration, and the power or thrust
must be constant throughout each segment and must correspond to the most
critical condition prevailing in the segment;
(3) The flight path must be based on the airplane's performance without
ground effect; and
(4) The takeoff path data must be checked by continuous demonstrated
takeoffs up to the point at which the airplane is out of ground effect and
its speed is stabilized, to ensure that the path is conservative relative to
the continous path.

The airplane is considered to be out of the ground effect when it reaches a
height equal to its wing span.
(e) For airplanes equipped with standby power rocket engines, the takeoff
path may be determined in accordance with section II of Appendix E.

takeoff surface at the end of the takeoff distance determined in accordance
with Sec. 25.113(a) or (b), as appropriate for the runway surface condition.

(2) 0.9 percent for three-engine airplanes; and

Sec. 25.121  Climb: One-engine-inoperative.

(a) Takeoff; landing gear extended.  In the critical takeoff configuration
existing along the flight path (between the points at which the airplane
reaches VLOF and at which the landing gear is fully retracted) and in the
configuration used in Sec. 25.111 but without ground effect, the steady
gradient of climb must be positive for two-engine airplanes, and not less
than 0.3 percent for three-engine airplanes or 0.5 percent for four-engine
airplanes, at VLOF and with--
(1) The critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at the power
or thrust available when retraction of the landing gear is begun in
accordance with Sec. 25.111 unless there is a more critical power operating
condition existing later along the flight path but before the point at which
the landing gear is fully retracted; and
(2) The weight equal to the weight existing when retraction of the landing
gear is begun, determined under Sec. 25.111.

airplane reaches a height of 400 feet above the takeoff surface; and
(2) The weight equal to the weight existing when the airplane's landing
gear is fully retracted, determined under Sec. 25.111.
(c) Final takeoff. In the en route configuration at the end of the takeoff
path determined in accordance with Sec. 25.111, the steady gradient of climb
may not be less than 1.2 percent for two-engine airplanes, 1.5 percent for
three-engine airplanes, and 1.7 percent for four-engine airplanes, at not
less than 1.25 VS and with--
(1) The critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at the

all-engines-operating procedure in which VS for this configuration does not
exceed 110 percent of the VS for the related landing configuration, the
steady gradient of climb may not be less than 2.1 percent for two-engine
airplanes, 2.4 percent for three-engine airplanes, and 2.7 percent for four-

Sec. 25.123  En route flight paths.

(a) For the en route configuration, the flight paths prescribed in
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be determined at each weight,
altitude, and ambient temperature, within the operating limits established
for the airplane. The variation of weight along the flight path, accounting
for the progressive consumption of fuel and oil by the operating engines, may
be included in the computation. The flight paths must be determined at any
selected speed, with--
(1) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
(2) The critical engines inoperative;
(3) The remaining engines at the available maximum continuous power or
thrust; and
(4) The means for controlling the engine-cooling air supply in the position
that provides adequate cooling in the hot-day condition.
(b) The one-engine-inoperative net flight path data must represent the
actual climb performance diminished by a gradient of climb of 1.1 percent for
two-engine airplanes, 1.4 percent for three-engine airplanes, and 1.6 percent
for four-engine airplanes.

stop (or to a speed of approximately 3 knots for water landings) from a point
50 feet above the landing surface must be determined (for standard
temperatures, at each weight, altitude, and wind within the operational
limits established by the applicant for the airplane) as follows:
(1) The airplane must be in the landing configuration.
(2) A stabilized approach, with a calibrated airspeed of not less than 1.3
VS or VMCL, whichever is greater, must be maintained down to the 50 foot
height.
(3) Changes in configuration, power or thrust, and speed, must be made in
accordance with the established procedures for service operation.
(4) The landing must be made without excessive vertical acceleration,
tendency to bounce, nose over, ground loop, porpoise, or water loop.
(5) The landings may not require exceptional piloting skill or alertness.
(b) For landplanes and amphibians, the landing distance on land must be
determined on a level, smooth, dry, hard-surfaced runway. In addition--
(1) The pressures on the wheel braking systems may not exceed those
specified by the brake manufacturer;
(2) The brakes may not be used so as to cause excessive wear of brakes or
tires; and
(3) Means other than wheel brakes may be used if that means--
(i) Is safe and reliable;
(ii) Is used so that consistent results can be expected in service; and
(iii) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the
airplane.
(c) For seaplanes and amphibians, the landing distance on water must be
determined on smooth water.
(d) For skiplanes, the landing distance on snow must be determined on
smooth, dry, snow.
(e) The landing distance data must include correction factors for not more
than 50 percent of the nominal wind components along the landing path
opposite to the direction of landing, and not less than 150 percent of the
nominal wind components along the landing path in the direction of landing.
(f) If any device is used that depends on the operation of any engine, and
if the landing distance would be noticeably increased when a landing is made
with that engine inoperative, the landing distance must be determined with
that engine inoperative unless the use of compensating means will result in a
landing distance not more than that with each engine operating.

             Controllability and Maneuverability




Sec. 25.143  General.

(a) The airplane must be safely controllable and maneuverable during--
(1) Takeoff;
(2) Climb;
(3) Level flight;
(4) Descent; and
(5) Landing.
(b) It must be possible to make a smooth transition from one flight
condition to any other flight condition without exceptional piloting skill,
alertness, or strength, and without danger of exceeding the airplane limit-
load factor under any probable operating conditions, including--
(1) The sudden failure of the critical engine;
(2) For airplanes with three or more engines, the sudden failure of the
second critical engine when the airplane is in the en route, approach, or
landing configuration and is trimmed with the critical engine inoperative;
and
(3) Configuration changes, including deployment or retraction of
deceleration devices.
(c) The following table prescribes, for conventional wheel type controls,
the maximum control forces permitted during the testing required by
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

Force, in pounds, applied to the control wheel or rudder
                  pedals                             Pitch  Roll  Yaw

For short term application for pitch and roll control--two
hands available for control                                    75    50
For short term application for pitch and roll control--one
hand available for control                                     50    25
For short term application for yaw control                                150
For long term application                                       10     5   20

(d) Approved operating procedures or conventional operating practices must
be followed when demonstrating compliance with the control force limitations
for short term application that are prescribed in paragraph (c) of this
section. The airplane must be in trim, or as near to being in trim as
practical, in the immediately preceding steady flight condition. For the
takeoff condition, the airplane must be trimmed according to the approved
operating procedures.
(e) When demonstrating compliance with the control force limitations for
long term application that are prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section,
the airplane must be in trim, or as near to being in trim as practical.
(f) When maneuvering at a constant airspeed or Mach number (up to VFC/MFC),
the stick forces and the gradient of the stick force versus maneuvering load
factor must lie within satisfactory limits. The stick forces must not be so
great as to make excessive demands on the pilot's strength when maneuvering
the airplane, and must not be so low that the airplane can easily be
overstressed inadvertently. Changes of gradient that occur with changes of
load factor must not cause undue difficulty in maintaining control of the
airplane, and local gradients must not be so low as to result in a danger of
overcontrolling.

25.145 Longitudinal control. 

(a) It must be possible at any speed between the trim speed prescribed in 
25.103(b)(1) and V[s], to pitch the nose downward so that the acceleration to this
selected trim speed is prompt with -- 
(1) The airplane trimmed at the trim speed prescribed in  25.103(b)(1). 
(2) The landing gear extended; 
(3) The wing flaps (i) retracted and (ii) extended; and 
(4) Power (i) off and (ii) at maximum continuous power on the engines. 
(b) With the landing gear extended, no change in trim control, or exertion of more
than 50 pounds control force (representative of the maximum short term force that
can be applied readily by one hand) may be required for the following maneuvers: 
(1) With power off, flaps retracted, and the airplane trimmed at 1.4 V[S1], extend
the flaps as rapidly as possible while maintaining the airspeed at approximately 40
percent above the stalling speed existing at each instant throughout the maneuver. 
(2) Repeat paragraph (b)(1) except initially extend the flaps and then retract them
as rapidly as possible. 
(3) Repeat paragraph (b)(2), except at the go-around power or thrust setting. 
(4) With power off, flaps retracted, and the airplane trimmed at 1.4 V[SI], rapidly
set go-around power or thrust while maintaining the same airspeed. 
(5) Repeat paragraph (b)(4) except with flaps extended. 
(6) With power off, flaps extended, and the airplane trimmed at 1.4 V[S1], obtain
and maintain airspeeds between 1.1 V[S1], and either 1.7 V[S1], or V[FE], whichever
is lower. 
(c) It must be possible, without exceptional piloting skill, to prevent loss of
altitude when complete retraction of the high-lift devices from any position is
begun during steady, straight, level flight at 1.1 V[S1] for propeller powered
airplanes, or 1.2V[S1] for turbojet powered airplanes, with -- 
(1) Simultaneous movement of the power or thrust controls to the go-around power or
thrust setting; 
(2) The landing gear extended; and 
(3) The critical combinations of landing weights and altitudes. 
(d) If gated high-lift device control positions are provided, paragraph (c) of this
section applies to retractions of the high-lift devices from any position from the
maximum landing position to the first gated position, between gated positions, and
from the last gated position to the fully retracted position. The requirements of
paragraph (c) of this section also apply to retractions from each approved landing
position to the control position(s) associated with the high-lift device
configuration(s) used to establish the go-around procedure(s) from that landing
position. In addition, the first gated control position from the maximum landing
position must correspond with a configuration of the high-lift devices used to
establish a go-around procedure from a landing configuration. Each gated control
position must require a separate and distinct motion of the control to pass through
the gated position and must have features to prevent inadvertent movement of the
control through the gated position. It must only be possible to make this separate
and distinct motion once the control has reached the gated position.

Sec. 25.147  Directional and lateral control.

(a) Directional control; general. It must be possible, with the wings
level, to yaw into the operative engine and to safely make a reasonably
sudden change in heading of up to 15 degrees in the direction of the critical
inoperative engine. This must be shown at 1.4Vs1 for heading changes up to 15
degrees (except that the heading change at which the rudder pedal force is
150 pounds need not be exceeded), and with--
(1) The critical engine inoperative and its propeller in the minimum drag
position;
(2) The power required for level flight at 1.4 VS1,  but not more than
maximum continuous power;
(3) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
(4) Landing gear retracted;
(5) Flaps in the approach position; and
(6) Maximum landing weight.
(b) Directional control; airplanes with four or more engines. Airplanes
with four or more engines must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this
section except that--
(1) The two critical engines must be inoperative with their propellers (if
applicable) in the minimum drag position;
(2) [Reserved]
(3) The flaps must be in the most favorable climb position.
(c) Lateral control; general. It must be possible to make 20 deg. banked
turns, with and against the inoperative engine, from steady flight at a speed
equal to 1.4 VS1,  with--
(1) The critical engine inoperative and its propeller (if applicable) in
the minimum drag position;
(2) The remaining engines at maximum continuous power;
(3) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
(4) Landing gear (i) retracted and (ii) extended;
(5) Flaps in the most favorable climb position; and
(6) Maximum takeoff weight.
(d) Lateral control; airplanes with four or more engines. Airplanes with
four or more engines must be able to make 20 deg. banked turns, with and
against the inoperative engines, from steady flight at a speed equal to 1.4
VS1,  with maximum continuous power, and with the airplane in the
configuration prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section.
(e) Lateral control; all engines operating.  With the engines operating,
roll response must allow normal maneuvers (such as recovery from upsets
produced by gusts and the initiation of evasive maneuvers). There must be
enough excess lateral control in sideslips (up to sideslip angles that might
be required in normal operation), to allow a limited amount of maneuvering
and to correct for gusts. Lateral control must be enough at any speed up to
VFC/MFC to provide a peak roll rate necessary for safety, without excessive
control forces or travel.

Sec. 25.149  Minimum control speed.

(a) In establishing the minimum control speeds required by this section,
the method used to simulate critical engine failure must represent the most
critical mode of powerplant failure with respect to controllability expected
in service.
(b) VMC is the calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical engine is
suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane
with that engine still inoperative and maintain straight flight with an angle
of bank of not more than 5 degrees.
(c) VMC may not exceed 1.2 VS with--
(1) Maximum available takeoff power or thrust on the engines;
(2) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
(3) The airplane trimmed for takeoff;
(4) The maximum sea level takeoff weight (or any lesser weight necessary to
show VMC);
(5) The airplane in the most critical takeoff configuration existing along
the flight path after the airplane becomes airborne, except with the landing
gear retracted;
(6) The airplane airborne and the ground effect negligible; and
(7) If applicable, the propeller of the inoperative engine--
(i) Windmilling;
(ii) In the most probable position for the specific design of the propeller
control; or
(iii) Feathered, if the airplane has an automatic feathering device
acceptable for showing compliance with the climb requirements of Sec. 25.121.
(d) The rudder forces required to maintain control at VMC may not exceed
150 pounds nor may it be necessary to reduce power or thrust of the operative
engines. During recovery, the airplane may not assume any dangerous attitude
or require exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength to prevent a
heading change of more than 20 degrees.
(e) VMCG, the minimum control speed on the ground, is the calibrated
airspeed during the takeoff run at which, when the critical engine is
suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane
using the rudder control alone (without the use of nosewheel steering), as
limited by 150 pounds of force, and the lateral control to the extent of
keeping the wings level to enable the takeoff to be safely continued using
normal piloting skill. In the determination of VMCG, assuming that the path
of the airplane accelerating with all engines operating is along the
centerline of the runway, its path from the point at which the critical
engine is made inoperative to the point at which recovery to a direction
parallel to the centerline is completed may not deviate more than 30 feet
laterally from the centerline at any point. VMCG must be established with--
(1) The airplane in each takeoff configuration or, at the option of the
applicant, in the most critical takeoff configuration;
(2) Maximum available takeoff power or thrust on the operating engines;
(3) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
(4) The airplane trimmed for takeoff; and
(5) The most unfavorable weight in the range of takeoff weights.
(f) VMCL, the minimum control speed during approach and landing with all
engines operating, is the calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical
engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of
the airplane with that engine still inoperative, and maintain straight flight
with an angle of bank of not more than 5 degrees. VMCL must be established
with--
(1) The airplane in the most critical configuration (or, at the option of
the applicant, each configuration) for approach and landing with all engines
operating;
(2) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
(3) The airplane trimmed for approach with all engines operating;

function of weight;
(5) For propeller airplanes, the propeller of the inoperative engine in the
position it achieves without pilot action, assuming the engine fails while at
the power or thrust necessary to maintain a three degree approach path angle;
and
(6) Go-around power or thrust setting on the operating engine(s).
(g) For airplanes with three or more engines, VMCL-2, the minimum control
speed during approach and landing with one critical engine inoperative, is
the calibrated airspeed at which, when a second critical engine is suddenly
made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane with
both engines still inoperative, and maintain straight flight with an angle of
bank of not more than 5 degrees. VMCL-2 must be established with--
(1) The airplane in the most critical configuration (or, at the option of
the applicant, each configuration) for approach and landing with one critical
engine inoperative;
(2) The most unfavorable center of gravity;
(3) The airplane trimmed for approach with one critical engine inoperative;
(4) The most unfavorable weight, or, at the option of the applicant, as a
function of weight;
(5) For propeller airplanes, the propeller of the more critical inoperative
engine in the position it achieves without pilot action, assuming the engine
fails while at the power or thrust necessary to maintain a three degree
approach path angle, and the propeller of the other inoperative engine
feathered;
(6) The power or thrust on the operating engine(s) necessary to maintain an
approach path angle of three degrees when one critical engine is inoperative;
and
(7) The power or thrust on the operating engine(s) rapidly changed,
immediately after the second critical engine is made inoperative, from the
power or thrust prescribed in paragraph (g)(6) of this section to--

(i) Minimum power or thrust; and

(ii) Go-around power or thrust setting.

(h) In demonstrations of VMCL and VMCL-2--

(1) The rudder force may not exceed 150 pounds;

(2) The airplane may not exhibit hazardous flight characteristics or
require exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength;

(3) Lateral control must be sufficient to roll the airplane, from an
initial condition of steady flight, through an angle of 20 degrees in the
direction necessary to initiate a turn away from the inoperative engine(s),
in not more than 5 seconds; and

(4) For propeller airplanes, hazardous flight characteristics must not be
exhibited due to any propeller position achieved when the engine fails or
during any likely subsequent movements of the engine or propeller controls.

Sec. 25.171  General.

The airplane must be longitudinally, directionally, and laterally stable in
accordance with the provisions of Secs. 25.173 through 25.177. In addition,
suitable stability and control feel (static stability) is required in any
condition normally encountered in service, if flight tests show it is
necessary for safe operation.

Under the conditions specified in Sec. 25.175, the characteristics of the
elevator control forces (including friction) must be as follows:
(a) A pull must be required to obtain and maintain speeds below the
specified trim speed, and a push must be required to obtain and maintain

operating limit speeds or VFC/MFC,  whichever is appropriate, or lower than
the minimum speed for steady unstalled flight.
(b) The airspeed must return to within 10 percent of the original trim
speed for the climb, approach, and landing conditions specified in Sec.
25.175 (a), (c), and (d), and must return to within 7.5 percent of the
original trim speed for the cruising condition specified in Sec. 25.175(b),
when the control force is slowly released from any speed within the range
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The average gradient of the stable slope of the stick force versus
speed curve may not be less than 1 pound for each 6 knots.
(d) Within the free return speed range specified in paragraph (b) of this

Sec. 25.177  Static lateral-directional stability.

(a) [Reserved]
(b) [Reserved]
(c) In straight, steady sideslips, the aileron and rudder control movements
and forces must be substantially proportional to the angle of sideslip in a
stable sense; and the factor of proportionality must lie between limits found
necessary for safe operation throughout the range of sideslip angles
appropriate to the operation of the airplane. At greater angles, up to the
angle at which full rudder is used or a rudder force of 180 pounds is
obtained, the rudder pedal forces may not reverse; and increased rudder
deflection must be needed for increased angles of sideslip. Compliance with
this paragraph must be demonstrated for all landing gear and flap positions
and symmetrical power conditions at speeds from 1.2 VS1 to VFE, VLE, or VFC/
MFC, as appropriate.
(d) The rudder gradients must meet the requirements of paragraph (c) at
speeds between VMO/MMO and VFC/MFC except that the dihedral effect (aileron
deflection opposite the corresponding rudder input) may be negative provided
the divergence is gradual, easily recognized, and easily controlled by the
pilot.

directional oscillations, occurring between 1.2 VS and maximum allowable
speed appropriate to the configuration of the airplane must be heavily
damped with the primary controls--
(1) Free; and
(2) In a fixed position.
(b) Any combined lateral-directional oscillations ("Dutch roll") occurring
between 1.2 VS and maximum allowable speed appropriate to the configuration
of the airplane must be positively damped with controls free, and must be
controllable with normal use of the primary controls without requiring
exceptional pilot skill.

                           Stalls




Sec. 25.201  Stall demonstration.

(a) Stalls must be shown in straight flight and in 30 degree banked turns
with--
(1) Power off; and
(2) The power necessary to maintain level flight at 1.6 VS1 (where VS1
corresponds to the stalling speed with flaps in the approach position, the
landing gear retracted, and maximum landing weight).
(b) In each condition required by paragraph (a) of this section, it must be
possible to meet the applicable requirements of Sec. 25.203 with--

(1) Flaps, landing gear, and deceleration devices in any likely combination
of positions approved for operation;

(2) Representative weights within the range for which certification is
requested;

(3) The most adverse center of gravity for recovery; and

(4) The airplane trimmed for straight flight at the speed prescribed in
Sec. 25.103(b)(1).

(c) The following procedures must be used to show compliance with Sec.
25.203;
(1) Starting at a speed sufficiently above the stalling speed to ensure
that a steady rate of speed reduction can be established, apply the
longitudinal control so that the speed reduction does not exceed one knot per
second until the airplane is stalled.
(2) In addition, for turning flight stalls, apply the longitudinal control
to achieve airspeed deceleration rates up to 3 knots per second.
(3) As soon as the airplane is stalled, recover by normal recovery
techniques.
(d) The airplane is considered stalled when the behavior of the airplane
gives the pilot a clear and distinctive indication of an acceptable nature
that the airplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring
either individually or in combination, are--
(1) A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested;
(2) Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective
deterrent to further speed reduction; or
(3) The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch
attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before
recovery is initiated.

FR 30750, June 9, 1995]


Sec. 25.203  Stall characteristics.

    (a) It must be possible to produce and to correct roll and yaw by 
unreversed use of the aileron and rudder controls, up to the time the 
airplane is stalled. No abnormal nose-up pitching may occur. The 
longitudinal control force must be positive up to and throughout the 
stall. In addition, it must be possible to promptly prevent stalling and 
to recover from a stall by normal use of the controls.
    (b) For level wing stalls, the roll occurring between the stall and 
the completion of the recovery may not exceed approximately 20 degrees.
    (c) For turning flight stalls, the action of the airplane after the 
stall may not be so violent or extreme as to make it difficult, with 
normal piloting skill, to effect a prompt recovery and to regain control 
of the airplane. The maximum bank angle that occurs during the recovery 
may not exceed--
    (1) Approximately 60 degrees in the original direction of the turn, 
or 30 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates up to 1 
knot per second; and
    (2) Approximately 90 degrees in the original direction of the turn, 
or 60 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates in 
excess of 1 knot per second.

Sec. 25.205  [Removed.  Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29775, July 20, 1990]


Sec. 25.207  Stall warning.

(a) Stall warning with sufficient margin to prevent inadvertent stalling
with the flaps and landing gear in any normal position must be clear and
distinctive to the pilot in straight and turning flight.
(b) The warning may be furnished either through the inherent aerodynamic
qualities of the airplane or by a device that will give clearly
distinguishable indications under expected conditions of flight. However, a
visual stall warning device that requires the attention of the crew within
the cockpit is not acceptable by itself. If a warning device is used, it must
provide a warning in each of the airplane configuations prescribed in
paragraph (a) of this section at the speed prescribed in paragraph (c) of
this section.
(c) The stall warning must begin at a speed exceeding the stalling speed
(i.e., the speed at which the airplane stalls or the minimum speed
demonstrated, whichever is applicable under the provisions of Sec. 25.201(d))
by seven percent or at any lesser margin if the stall warning has enough
clarity, duration, distinctiveness, or similar properties.

          Ground and Water Handling Characteristics






Sec. 25.231  Longitudinal stability and control.

(a) Landplanes may have no uncontrollable tendency to nose over in any
reasonably expected operating condition or when rebound occurs during landing
or takeoff. In addition--
(1) Wheel brakes must operate smoothly and may not cause any undue tendency
to nose over; and
(2) If a tail-wheel landing gear is used, it must be possible, during the
takeoff ground run on concrete, to maintain any altitude up to thrust line
level, at 80 percent of VS1.
(b) For seaplanes and amphibians, the most adverse water conditions safe
for takeoff, taxiing, and landing, must be established.






Sec. 25.233  Directional stability and control.

(a) There may be no uncontrollable ground-looping tendency in 90 deg. cross
winds, up to a wind velocity of 20 knots or 0.2 VS0, whichever is greater,
except that the wind velocity need not exceed 25 knots at any speed at which
the airplane may be expected to be operated on the ground. This may be shown
while establishing the 90 deg. cross component of wind velocity required by
Sec. 25.237.
(b) Landplanes must be satisfactorily controllable, without exceptional
piloting skill or alertness, in power-off landings at normal landing speed,
without using brakes or engine power to maintain a straight path. This may be
shown during power-off landings made in conjunction with other tests.
(c) The airplane must have adequate directional control during taxiing.
This may be shown during taxiing prior to takeoffs made in conjunction with
other tests.

Sec. 25.235  Taxiing condition.

The shock absorbing mechanism may not damage the structure of the airplane
when the airplane is taxied on the roughest ground that may reasonably be
expected in normal operation.






Sec. 25.237  Wind velocities.

(a) For landplanes and amphibians, a 90-degree cross component of wind
velocity, demonstrated to be safe for takeoff and landing, must be
established for dry runways and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2 VS0,
whichever is greater, except that it need not exceed 25 knots.
(b) For seaplanes and amphibians, the following applies:
(1) A 90-degree cross component of wind velocity, up to which takeoff and
landing is safe under all water conditions that may reasonably be expected in
normal operation, must be established and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2
Vs0, whichever is greater, except that it need not exceed 25 knots.
(2) A wind velocity, for which taxiing is safe in any direction under all
water conditions that may reasonably be expected in normal operation, must be
established and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2 VS0, whichever is greater,
except that it need not exceed 25 knots.

[Amdt. 25-42, 43 FR 2322, Jan. 16, 1978]






Sec. 25.239  Spray characteristics, control, and stability on water.

(a) For seaplanes and amphibians, during takeoff, taxiing, and landing, and
in the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, there may be
no--
(1) Spray characteristics that would impair the pilot's view, cause damage,
or result in the taking in of an undue quantity of water;
(2) Dangerously uncontrollable porpoising, bounding, or swinging tendency;
or
(3) Immersion of auxiliary floats or sponsons, wing tips, propeller blades,
or other parts not designed to withstand the resulting water loads.
(b) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must
be shown--
(1) In water conditions, from smooth to the most adverse condition
established in accordance with Sec. 25.231;
(2) In wind and cross-wind velocities, water currents, and associated waves
and swells that may reasonably be expected in operation on water;
(3) At speeds that may reasonably be expected in operation on water;
(4) With sudden failure of the critical engine at any time while on water;
and
(5) At each weight and center of gravity position, relevant to each
operating condition, within the range of loading conditions for which
certification is requested.
(c) In the water conditions of paragraph (b) of this section, and in the
corresponding wind conditions, the seaplane or amphibian must be able to
drift for five minutes with engines inoperative, aided, if necessary, by a
sea anchor.






              Miscellaneous Flight Requirements






Sec. 25.251  Vibration and buffeting.

(a) The airplane must be demonstrated in flight to be free from any
vibration and buffeting that would prevent continued safe flight in any
likely operating condition.
(b) Each part of the airplane must be demonstrated in flight to be free
from excessive vibration under any appropriate speed and power conditions up
to VDF/MDF. The maximum speeds shown must be used in establishing the
operating limitations of the airplane in accordance with Sec. 25.1505.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, there may be no
buffeting condition, in normal flight, including configuration changes during
cruise, severe enough to interfere with the control of the airplane, to cause
excessive fatigue to the crew, or to cause structural damage. Stall warning
buffeting within these limits is allowable.
(d) There may be no perceptible buffeting condition in the cruise
configuration in straight flight at any speed up to VMO/MMO, except that
stall warning buffeting is allowable.
(e) For an airplane with MD greater than .6 or with a maximum operating
altitude greater than 25,000 feet, the positive maneuvering load factors at
which the onset of perceptible buffeting occurs must be determined with the
airplane in the cruise configuration for the ranges of airspeed or Mach
number, weight, and altitude for which the airplane is to be certificated.
The envelopes of load factor, speed, altitude, and weight must provide a
sufficient range of speeds and load factors for normal operations. Probable
inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes
may not result in unsafe conditions.

FR 28949, June 29, 1992]




Sec. 25.253  High-speed characteristics.

(a) Speed increase and recovery characteristics.  The following speed
increase and recovery characteristics must be met:
(1) Operating conditions and characteristics likely to cause inadvertent
speed increases (including upsets in pitch and roll) must be simulated with
the airplane trimmed at any likely cruise speed up to VMO/MMO. These
conditions and characteristics include gust upsets, inadvertent control
movements, low stick force gradient in relation to control friction,
passenger movement, leveling off from climb, and descent from Mach to
airspeed limit altitudes.
(2) Allowing for pilot reaction time after effective inherent or artificial
speed warning occurs, it must be shown that the airplane can be recovered to
a normal attitude and its speed reduced to VMO/MMO, without-
(i) Exceptional piloting strength or skill;
(ii) Exceeding VD/MD, VDF/MDF, or the structural limitations; and
(iii) Buffeting that would impair the pilot's ability to read the
instruments or control the airplane for recovery.
(3) With the airplane trimmed at any speed up to VMO /MMO, there must be no
reversal of the response to control input about any axis at any speed up to
VDF/MDF. Any tendency to pitch, roll, or yaw must be mild and readily
controllable, using normal piloting techniques. When the airplane is trimmed
at VMO/MMO, the slope of the elevator control force versus speed curve need
not be stable at speeds greater than VFC/MFC, but there must be a push force
at all speeds up to VDF/MDF and there must be no sudden or excessive
reduction of elevator control force as VDF/MDF is reached.
(b) Maximum speed for stability characteristics, VFC/MFC. VFC/MFC is the
maximum speed at which the requirements of Secs. 25.143(f), 25.147(e),
25.175(b)(1), 25.177, and 25.181 must be met with flaps and landing gear
retracted. It may not be less than a speed midway between VMO/MMO and VDF/

need not exceed the Mach number at which effective speed warning occurs.

Sec. 25.255  Out-of-trim characteristics.

(a) From an initial condition with the airplane trimmed at cruise speeds up
to VMO/MMO, the airplane must have satisfactory maneuvering stability and
controllability with the degree of out-of-trim in both the airplane nose-up
and nose-down directions, which results from the greater of--
(1) A three-second movement of the longitudinal trim system at its normal
rate for the particular flight condition with no aerodynamic load (or an
equivalent degree of trim for airplanes that do not have a power-operated
trim system), except as limited by stops in the trim system, including those
required by Sec. 25.655(b) for adjustable stabilizers; or
(2) The maximum mistrim that can be sustained by the autopilot while
maintaining level flight in the high speed cruising condition.
(b) In the out-of-trim condition specified in paragraph (a) of this
section, when the normal acceleration is varied from +1 g to the positive and
negative values specified in paragraph (c) of this section--
(1) The stick force vs. g curve must have a positive slope at any speed up
to and including VFC/MFC; and
(2) At speeds between VFC/MFC and VDF/MDF the direction of the primary
longitudinal control force may not reverse.
(c) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section,
compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section must be
demonstrated in flight over the acceleration range--
(1) -1 g to +2.5 g; or
(2) 0 g to 2.0 g, and extrapolating by an acceptable method to -1 g and
+2.5 g.
(d) If the procedure set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is used
to demonstrate compliance and marginal conditions exist during flight test
with regard to reversal of primary longitudinal control force, flight tests
must be accomplished from the normal acceleration at which a marginal
condition is found to exist to the applicable limit specified in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section.
(e) During flight tests required by paragraph (a) of this section, the
limit maneuvering load factors prescribed in Secs. 25.333(b) and 25.337, and
the maneuvering load factors associated with probable inadvertent excursions
beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes determined under Sec.
25.251(e), need not be exceeded. In addition, the entry speeds for flight
test demonstrations at normal acceleration values less than 1 g must be
limited to the extent necessary to accomplish a recovery without exceeding
VDF/MDF.
(f) In the out-of-trim condition specified in paragraph (a) of this
section, it must be possible from an overspeed condition at VDF/MDF to
produce at least 1.5 g for recovery by applying not more than 125 pounds of
longitudinal control force using either the primary longitudinal control
alone or the primary longitudinal control and the longitudinal trim system.
If the longitudinal trim is used to assist in producing the required load
factor, it must be shown at VDF/MDF that the longitudinal trim can be
actuated in the airplane nose-up direction with the primary surface loaded to
correspond to the least of the following airplane nose-up control forces:
(1) The maximum control forces expected in service as specified in Secs.
25.301 and 25.397.
(2) The control force required to produce 1.5 g.
(3) The control force corresponding to buffeting or other phenomena of such
intensity that it is a strong deterrent to further application of primary
longitudinal control force.

                           General






Sec. 25.301  Loads.

(a) Strength requirements are specified in terms of limit loads (the
maximum loads to be expected in service) and ultimate loads (limit loads
multiplied by prescribed factors of safety). Unless otherwise provided,
prescribed loads are limit loads.
(b) Unless otherwise provided, the specified air, ground, and water loads
must be placed in equilibrium with inertia forces, considering each item of
mass in the airplane. These loads must be distributed to conservatively
approximate or closely represent actual conditions. Methods used to determine
load intensities and distribution must be validated by flight load
measurement unless the methods used for determining those loading conditions
are shown to be reliable.
(c) If deflections under load would significantly change the distribution
of external or internal loads, this redistribution must be taken into
account.

Sec. 25.303  Factor of safety.

Unless otherwise specified, a factor of safety of 1.5 must be applied to
the prescribed limit load which are considered external loads on the
structure. When a loading condition is prescribed in terms of ultimate loads,
a factor of safety need not be applied unless otherwise specified.

[Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5672, Apr. 8, 1970]






Sec. 25.305  Strength and deformation.

(a) The structure must be able to support limit loads without detrimental
permanent deformation. At any load up to limit loads, the deformation may not
interfere with safe operation.
(b) The structure must be able to support ultimate loads without failure
for at least 3 seconds. However, when proof of strength is shown by dynamic
tests simulating actual load conditions, the 3-second limit does not apply.
Static tests conducted to ultimate load must include the ultimate deflections
and ultimate deformation induced by the loading. When analytical methods are
used to show compliance with the ultimate load strength requirements, it must
be shown that--
(1) The effects of deformation are not significant;
(2) The deformations involved are fully accounted for in the analysis; or
(3) The methods and assumptions used are sufficient to cover the effects of
these deformations.
(c) Where structural flexibility is such that any rate of load application
likely to occur in the operating conditions might produce transient stresses
appreciably higher than those corresponding to static loads, the effects of
this rate of application must be considered.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) The airplane must be designed to withstand any vibration and buffeting
that might occur in any likely operating condition up to VD/MD, including
stall and probable inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet
onset envelope. This must be shown by analysis, flight tests, or other tests
found necessary by the Administrator.
(f) Unless shown to be extremely improbable, the airplane must be designed
to withstand any forced structural vibration resulting from any failure,
malfunction or adverse condition in the flight control system. These must be
considered limit loads and must be investigated at airspeeds up to VC/MC.

Sec. 25.307   Proof of structure.

(a) Compliance with the strength and deformation requirements of this
subpart must be shown for each critical loading condition. Structural
analysis may be used only if the structure conforms to that for which
experience has shown this method to be reliable. The Administrator may
require ultimate load tests in cases where limit load tests may be
inadequate.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) [Reserved]
(d) When static or dynamic tests are used to show compliance with the
requirements of Sec. 25.305(b) for flight structures, appropriate material
correction factors must be applied to the test results, unless the structure,
or part thereof, being tested has features such that a number of elements
contribute to the total strength of the structure and the failure of one
element results in the redistribution of the load through alternate load
paths.

                        Flight Loads



Sec. 25.321  General.

(a) Flight load factors represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force
component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the airplane) to
the weight of the airplane. A positive load factor is one in which the
aerodynamic force acts upward with respect to the airplane.
(b) Considering compressibility effects at each speed, compliance with the
flight load requirements of this subpart must be shown--
(1) At each critical altitude within the range of altitudes selected by the
applicant;
(2) At each weight from the design minimum weight to the design maximum
weight appropriate to each particular flight load condition; and
(3) For each required altitude and weight, for any practicable distribution
of disposable load within the operating limitations recorded in the Airplane
Flight Manual.
(c) Enough points on and within the boundaries of the design envelope must
be investigated to ensure that the maximum load for each part of the airplane
structure is obtained.
(d) The significant forces acting on the airplane must be placed in
equilibrium in a rational or conservative manner. The linear inertia forces
must be considered in equilibrium with the thrust and all aerodynamic loads,
while the angular (pitching) inertia forces must be considered in equilibrium
with thrust and all aerodynamic moments, including moments due to loads on
components such as tail surfaces and nacelles. Critical thrust values in the
range from zero to maximum continuous thrust must be considered.

             Flight Maneuver and Gust Conditions




Sec. 25.331   Symmetric maneuvering conditions.

(a) Procedure. For the analysis of the maneuvering flight conditions
specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the following provisions
apply:
(1) Where sudden displacement of a control is specified, the assumed rate
of control surface displacement may not be less than the rate that could be
applied by the pilot through the control system.
(2) In determining elevator angles and chordwise load distribution in the
maneuvering conditions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the effect
of corresponding pitching velocities must be taken into account. The in-trim
and out-of-trim flight conditions specified in Sec. 25.255 must be
considered.
(b) Maneuvering balanced conditions.  Assuming the airplane to be in
equilibrium with zero pitching acceleration, the maneuvering conditions A
through I on the maneuvering envelope in Sec. 25.333(b) must be investigated.
(c) Pitch maneuver conditions. The conditions specified in paragraphs
(c)(1) and (2) of this section must be investigated. The movement of the
pitch control surfaces may be adjusted to take into account limitations
imposed by the maximum pilot effort specified by Sec. 25.397(b), control
system stops and any indirect effect imposed by limitations in the output
side of the control system (for example, stalling torque or maximum rate
obtainable by a power control system.)
(1) Maximum pitch control displacement at VA. The airplane is assumed to be
flying in steady level flight (point A1, Sec. 25.333(b)) and the cockpit
pitch control is suddenly moved to obtain extreme nose up pitching
acceleration. In defining the tail load, the response of the airplane must be
taken into account. Airplane loads that occur subsequent to the time when
normal acceleration at the c.g. exceeds the positive limit maneuvering load
factor (at point A2 in Sec. 25.333(b)), or the resulting tailplane normal
load reaches its maximum, whichever occurs first, need not be considered.
(2) Specified control displacement. A checked maneuver, based on a rational
pitching control motion vs. time profile, must be established in which the
design limit load factor specified in Sec. 25.337 will not be exceeded.
Unless lesser values cannot be exceeded, the airplane response must result in
pitching accelerations not less than the following:
(i) A positive pitching acceleration (nose up) is assumed to be reached
concurrently with the airplane load factor of 1.0 (Points A1 to D1, Sec.
25.333(b)). The positive acceleration must be equal to at least

               39n
              ----    (n-1.5), (Radians/sec./2/ )
                 v

where--

n is the positive load factor at the speed under consideration, and V is the
airplane equivalent speed in knots.

(ii) A negative pitching acceleration (nose down) is assumed to be reached
concurrently with the positive maneuvering load factor (Points A2 to D2,
Sec. 25.333(b)). This negative pitching acceleration must be equal to at
least

               -26n
             ------    (n-1.5), (Radians/sec./2/ )
                  v

where--

n is the positive load factor at the speed under consideration; and V is the
airplane equivalent speed in knots.

(a) General. The strength requirements must be met at each combination of
airspeed and load factor on and within the boundaries of the representative
maneuvering envelope (V-n diagram) of paragraph (b) of this section. This
envelope must also be used in determining the airplane structural operating
limitations as specified in Sec. 25.1501.

Sec. 25.335  Design airspeeds.

The selected design airspeeds are equivalent airspeeds (EAS). Estimated
values of VS0 and VS1 must be conservative.
(a) Design cruising speed, VC. For VC, the following apply:
(1) The minimum value of VC must be sufficiently greater than VB to provide
for inadvertent speed increases likely to occur as a result of severe
atmospheric turbulence.
(2) Except as provided in Sec. 25.335(d)(2), VC may not be less than VB +
1.32 U REF (with UREF as specified in Sec. 25.341(a)(5)(i)). However VC need
not exceed the maximum speed in level flight at maximum continuous power for
the corresponding altitude.
(3) At altitudes where VD is limited by Mach number, VC may be limited to a
selected Mach number.
(b) Design dive speed, VD. VD must be selected so that VC/MC is not greater
than 0.8 VD/MD, or so that the minimum speed margin between VC/MC and VD/MD
is the greater of the following values:
(1) From an initial condition of stabilized flight at VC/MC, the airplane
is upset, flown for 20 seconds along a flight path 7.5 deg. below the initial
path, and then pulled up at a load factor of 1.5 g (0.5 g  acceleration
increment). The speed increase occurring in this maneuver may be calculated
if reliable or conservative aerodynamic data is used. Power as specified in
Sec. 25.175(b)(1)(iv) is assumed until the pullup is initiated, at which time
power reduction and the use of pilot controlled drag devices may be assumed;
(2) The minimum speed margin must be enough to provide for atmospheric
variations (such as horizontal gusts, and penetration of jet streams and cold
fronts) and for instrument errors and airframe production variations. These
factors may be considered on a probability basis. The margin at altitude
where MC is limited by compressibility effects must not less than 0.07M
unless a lower margin is determined using a rational analysis that includes
the effects of any automatic systems. In any case, the margin may not be
reduced to less than 0.05M.
(c) Design maneuvering speed VA. For VA, the following apply:
(1) VA may not be less than VS1 <radical>n where--
(i) n is the limit positive maneuvering load factor at VC; and
(ii) VS1 is the stalling speed with flaps retracted.
(2) VA and VS must be evaluated at the design weight and altitude under
consideration.
(3) VA need not be more than VC or the speed at which the positive CN max
curve intersects the positive maneuver load factor line, whichever is less.
(d) Design speed for maximum gust intensity, VB.
(1) VB may not be less than

VS1 [1 + Kg Uref Vc a / 498w]**

where--
VS1=the 1-g stalling speed based on CNAmax with the flaps retracted at the
particular weight under consideration;
Vc=design cruise speed (knots equivalent airspeed);
Uref=the reference gust velocity (feet per second equivalent airspeed) from
Sec. 25.341(a)(5)(i);
w=average wing loading (pounds per square foot) at the particular weight
under consideration.

.88mu
Kg = --------
5.3 + mu

 2w
mu = ---------
rho c a g

r=density of air (slugs/ft3);
c=mean geometric chord of the wing (feet);
g=acceleration due to gravity (ft/sec2);
a=slope of the airplane normal force coefficient curve, CNA per radian;

(2) At altitudes where VC is limited by Mach number--
(i) VB may be chosen to provide an optimum margin between low and high
speed buffet boundaries; and,
(ii) VB need not be greater than VC.
(e) Design flap speeds, VF. For VF, the following apply:
(1) The design flap speed for each flap position (established in accordance
with Sec. 25.697(a)) must be sufficiently greater than the operating speed
recommended for the corresponding stage of flight (including balked landings)
to allow for probable variations in control of airspeed and for transition
from one flap position to another.
(2) If an automatic flap positioning or load limiting device is used, the
speeds and corresponding flap positions programmed or allowed by the device
may be used.
(3) VF may not be less than--
(i) 1.6 VS1 with the flaps in takeoff position at maximum takeoff weight;
(ii) 1.8 VS1 with the flaps in approach position at maximum landing weight,
and
(iii) 1.8 VS0 with the flaps in landing position at maximum landing weight.
(f) Design drag device speeds, VDD. The selected design speed for each drag
device must be sufficiently greater than the speed recommended for the
operation of the device to allow for probable variations in speed control.
For drag devices intended for use in high speed descents, VDD may not be less
than VD. When an automatic drag device positioning or load limiting means is
used, the speeds and corresponding drag device positions programmed or
allowed by the automatic means must be used for design.

Sec. 25.337  Limit maneuvering load factors.

(a) Except where limited by maximum (static) lift coefficients, the
airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers resulting in the
limit maneuvering load factors prescribed in this section. Pitching
velocities appropriate to the corresponding pull-up and steady turn maneuvers
must be taken into account.
(b) The positive limit maneuvering load factor "n" for any speed up to Vn
may not be less than 2.1+24,000/ (W +10,000) except that "n" may not be less
than 2.5 and need not be greater than 3.8--where "W" is the design maximum
takeoff weight.
(c) The negative limit maneuvering load factor--
(1) May not be less than -1.0 at speeds up to VC; and
(2) Must vary linearly with speed from the value at VC to zero at VD.
(d) Maneuvering load factors lower than those specified in this section may
be used if the airplane has design features that make it impossible to exceed
these values in flight.

Sec. 25.341  Gust and turbulence loads.

(a) Discrete Gust Design Criteria. The airplane is assumed to be subjected
to symmetrical vertical and lateral gusts in level flight. Limit gust loads
must be determined in accordance with the provisions:
(1) Loads on each part of the structure must be determined by dynamic
analysis. The analysis must take into account unsteady aerodynamic
characteristics and all significant structural degrees of freedom including
rigid body motions.
(2) The shape of the gust must be:

Uds
U = ----- [1 - Cos (pi/H)]
2

for 0 </= s </= 2H
where--
s=distance penetrated into the gust (feet);
Uds=the design gust velocity in equivalent airspeed specified in paragraph
(a)(4) of this section; and
H=the gust gradient which is the distance (feet) parallel to the airplane's
flight path for the gust to reach its peak velocity.

(3) A sufficient number of gust gradient distances in the range 30 feet to
350 feet must be investigated to find the critical response for each load
quantity.
(4) The design gust velocity must be:

Uds = Uref Fg (H/350)**1/6

where--
Uref=the reference gust velocity in equivalent airspeed defined in paragraph
(a)(5) of this section.
Fg=the flight profile alleviation factor defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this
section.

(5) The following reference gust velocities apply:
(i) At the airplane design speed VC: Positive and negative gusts with
reference gust velocities of 56.0 ft/sec EAS must be considered at sea level.
The reference gust velocity may be reduced linearly from 56.0 ft/sec EAS at
sea level to 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15000 feet. The reference gust velocity may
be further reduced linearly from 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15000 feet to 26.0 ft/sec
EAS at 50000 feet.
(ii) At the airplane design speed VD: The reference gust velocity must be
0.5 times the value obtained under Sec. 25.341(a)(5)(i).
(6) The flight profile alleviation factor, Fg, must be increased linearly
from the sea level value to a value of 1.0 at the maximum operating altitude
defined in Sec. 25.1527. At sea level, the flight profile alleviation factor
is determined by the following equation:

Fg = 0.5 (Fgz + Fgm)

Where:

      Zmo
Fgz = 1 - ------------;
     250000

Fgm = (square root of:) R2 Tan(Pi R1/4);

Maximum Landing Weight
R1 = -------------------------;
Maximum Take-off Weight

Maximum Zero Fuel Weight
R2 = ---------------------------;
Maximum Take-off Weight

Zmo=Maximum operating altitude defined in Sec. 25.1527.

(7) When a stability augmentation system is included in the analysis, the
effect of any significant system nonlinearities should be accounted for when
deriving limit loads from limit gust conditions.
(b) Continuous Gust Design Criteria. The dynamic response of the airplane
to vertical and lateral continuous turbulence must be taken into account. The
continuous gust design criteria of Appendix G of this part must be used to
establish the dynamic response unless more rational criteria are shown.

Sec. 25.343  Design fuel and oil loads.

(a) The disposable load combinations must include each fuel and oil load in
the range from zero fuel and oil to the selected maximum fuel and oil load. A
structural reserve fuel condition, not exceeding 45 minutes of fuel under the
operating conditions in Sec. 25.1001(e) and (f), as applicable, may be
selected.
(b) If a structural reserve fuel condition is selected, it must be used as
the minimum fuel weight condition for showing compliance with the flight load
requirements as prescribed in this subpart. In addition--
(1) The structure must be designed for a condition of zero fuel and oil in
the wing at limit loads corresponding to--
(i) A maneuvering load factor of +2.25; and
(ii) The gust conditions of Sec. 25.341(a) but assuming 85% of the design
velocities prescribed in Sec. 25.341(a)(4).
(2) Fatigue evaluation of the structure must account for any increase in
operating stresses resulting from the design condition of paragraph (b)(1) of
this section; and
(3) The flutter, deformation, and vibration requirements must also be met
with zero fuel.

Sec. 25.345  High lift devices.

(a) If wing flaps are to be used during takeoff, approach, or landing, at
the design flap speeds established for these stages of flight under Sec.
25.335(e) and with the wing flaps in the corresponding positions, the
airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers and gusts. The
resulting limit loads must correspond to the conditions determined as
follows:
(1) Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor of 2.0; and
(2) Positive and negative gusts of 25 ft/sec EAS acting normal to the
flight path in level flight. Gust loads resulting on each part of the
structure must be determined by rational analysis. The analysis must take
into account the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics and rigid body motions
of the aircraft. The shape of the gust must be as described in Sec.
25.341(a)(2) except that--

Uds=25 ft/sec EAS;
H=12.5 c; and
c=mean geometric chord of the wing (feet).
(b) The airplane must be designed for the conditions prescribed in
paragraph (a) of this section, except that the airplane load factor need not
exceed 1.0, taking into account, as separate conditions, the effects of--
(1) Propeller slipstream corresponding to maximum continuous power at the
design flap speeds VF, and with takeoff power at not less than 1.4 times the
stalling speed for the particular flap position and associated maximum
weight; and
(2) A head-on gust of 25 feet per second velocity (EAS).
(c) If flaps or other high lift devices are to be used in en route
conditions, and with flaps in the appropriate position at speeds up to the
flap design speed chosen for these conditions, the airplane is assumed to be
subjected to symmetrical maneuvers and gusts within the range determined by--
(1) Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor as prescribed in Sec.
25.337(b); and
(2) The discrete vertical gust criteria in Sec. 25.341(a).
(d) The airplane must be designed for a maneuvering load factor of 1.5 g at
the maximum take-off weight with the wing-flaps and similar high lift devices
in the landing configurations.

Sec. 25.349  Rolling conditions.

The airplane must be designed for loads resulting from the rolling
conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Unbalanced
aerodynamic moments about the center of gravity must be reacted in a rational
or conservative manner, considering the principal masses furnishing the
reacting inertia fores.
(a) Maneuvering. The following conditions, speeds, and aileron deflections
(except as the deflections may be limited by pilot effort) must be considered
in combination with an airplane load factor of zero and of two-thirds of the
positive maneuvering factor used in design. In determining the required
aileron deflections, the torsional flexibility of the wing must be considered
in accordance with Sec. 25.301(b):
(1) Conditions corresponding to steady rolling velocities must be
investigated. In addition, conditions corresponding to maximum angular
acceleration must be investigated for airplanes with engines or other weight
concentrations outboard of the fuselage. For the angular acceleration
conditions, zero rolling velocity may be assumed in the absence of a rational
time history investigation of the maneuver.
(2) At VA,  a sudden deflection of the aileron to the stop is assumed.
(3) At VC,  the aileron deflection must be that required to produce a rate
of roll not less than that obtained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(4) At VD,  the aileron deflection must be that required to produce a rate
of roll not less than one-third of that in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(b) Unsymmetrical gusts. The airplane is assumed to be subjected to
unsymmetrical vertical gusts in level flight. The resulting limit loads must
be determined from either the wing maximum airload derived directly from Sec.
25.341(a), or the wing maximum airload derived indirectly from the vertical
load factor calculated from Sec. 25.341(a). It must be assumed that 100
percent of the wing air load acts on one side of the airplane and 80 percent
of the wing air load acts on the other side.

Sec. 25.351  Yaw maneuver conditions.

The airplane must be designed for loads resulting from the yaw maneuver
conditions specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section at speeds
from VMC to VD. Unbalanced aerodynamic moments about the center of gravity
must be reacted in a rational or conservative manner considering the airplane
inertia forces. In computing the tail loads the yawing velocity may be
assumed to be zero.
(a) With the airplane in unaccelerated flight at zero yaw, it is assumed
that the cockpit rudder control is suddenly displaced to achieve the
resulting rudder deflection, as limited by:
(1) The control system on control surface stops; or
(2) A limit pilot force of 300 pounds from VMC to VA and 200 pounds from
VC/MC to VD/MD, with a linear variation between VA and VC/MC.
(b) With the cockpit rudder control deflected so as always to maintain the
maximum rudder deflection available within the limitations specified in
paragraph (a) of this section, it is assumed that the airplane yaws to the
overswing sideslip angle.
(c) With the airplane yawed to the static equilibrium sideslip angle, it is
assumed that the cockpit rudder control is held so as to achieve the maximum
rudder deflection available within the limitations specified in paragraph (a)
of this section.
(d) With the airplane yawed to the static equilibrium sideslip angle of
paragraph (c) of this section, it is assumed that the cockpit rudder control
is suddenly returned to neutral.

specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, a limit engine torque
corresponding to takeoff power and propeller speed, multiplied by a factor
accounting for propeller control system malfunction, including quick
feathering, acting simultaneously with 1g level flight loads. In the absence
of a rational analysis, a factor of 1.6 must be used.

section must be obtained by multiplying mean torque for the specified power
and speed by a factor of--

Sec. 25.363   Side load on engine and auxiliary power unit mounts.

(a) Each engine and auxiliary power unit mount and its supporting structure
must be designed for a limit load factor in lateral direction, for the side
load on the engine and auxiliary power unit mount, at least equal to the
maximum load factor obtained in the yawing conditions but not less than--
(1) 1.33; or

loads combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum
relief valve setting.
(b) The external pressure distribution in flight, and stress concentrations
and fatigue effects must be accounted for.
(c) If landings may be made with the compartment pressurized, landing loads
must be combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum
allowed during landing.
(d) The airplane structure must be designed to be able to withstand the
pressure differential loads corresponding to the maximum relief valve setting
multiplied by a factor of 1.33 for airplanes to be approved for operation to
45,000 feet or by a factor of 1.67 for airplanes to be approved for operation
above 45,000 feet, omitting other loads.
(e) Any structure, component or part, inside or outside a pressurized
compartment, the failure of which could interfere with continued safe flight
and landing, must be designed to withstand the effects of a sudden release of
pressure through an opening in any compartment at any operating altitude
resulting from each of the following conditions:
(1) The penetration of the compartment by a portion of an engine following
an engine disintegration;
(2) Any opening in any pressurized compartment up to the size Ho in square
feet; however, small compartments may be combined with an adjacent
pressurized compartment and both considered as a single compartment for
openings that cannot reasonably be expected to be confined to the small
compartment. The size Ho must be computed by the following formula:

Ho=PAs
where,
Ho=Maximum opening in square feet, need not exceed 20 square feet.

                           As
                      P = ---- +.024
                          6240

As=Maximum cross-sectional area of the pressurized shell normal to the
longitudinal axis, in square feet; and

(3) The maximum opening caused by airplane or equipment failures not shown
to be extremely improbable.
(f) In complying with paragraph (e) of this section, the fail-safe features
of the design may be considered in determining the probability of failure or
penetration and probable size of openings, provided that possible improper
operation of closure devices and inadvertent door openings are also
considered. Furthermore, the resulting differential pressure loads must be
combined in a rational and conservative manner with 1-g level flight loads
and any loads arising from emergency depressurization conditions. These loads
may be considered as ultimate conditions; however, any deformations
associated with these conditions must not interfere with continued safe
flight and landing. The pressure relief provided by intercompartment venting
may also be considered.
(g) Bulkheads, floors, and partitions in pressurized compartments for
occupants must be designed to withstand the conditions specified in paragraph
(e) of this section. In addition, reasonable design precautions must be taken
to minimize the probability of parts becoming detached and injuring occupants
while in their seats.

Sec. 25.367  Unsymmetrical loads due to engine failure.

(a) The airplane must be designed for the unsymmetrical loads resulting
from the failure of the critical engine. Turbopropeller airplanes must be
designed for the following conditions in combination with a single
malfunction of the propeller drag limiting system, considering the probable
pilot corrective action on the flight controls:
(1) At speeds between VMC and VD, the loads resulting from power failure
because of fuel flow interruption are considered to be limit loads.
(2) At speeds between VMC and VC, the loads resulting from the
disconnection of the engine compressor from the turbine or from loss of the
turbine blades are considered to be ultimate loads.
(3) The time history of the thrust decay and drag build-up occurring as a
result of the prescribed engine failures must be substantiated by test or
other data applicable to the particular engine-propeller combination.
(4) The timing and magnitude of the probable pilot corrective action must
be conservatively estimated, considering the characteristics of the
particular engine-propeller-airplane combination.
(b) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the time
maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than two seconds after
the engine failure. The magnitude of the corrective action may be based on
the control forces specified in Sec. 25.397(b) except that lower forces may
be assumed where it is shown by anaylsis or test that these forces can
control the yaw and roll resulting from the prescribed engine failure
conditions.






Sec. 25.371  Gyroscopic loads.

The structure supporting any engine or auxiliary power unit must be
designed for the loads including the gyroscopic loads arising from the
conditions specified in Secs. 25.331, 25.341(a), 25.349, 25.351, 25.473,
25.479, and 25.481, with the engine or auxiliary power unit at the maximum
rpm appropriate to the condition. For the purposes of compliance with this

the positive limit maneuvering load factor (point A2 in Sec. 25.333(b)) is
reached.

in Sec. 25.333 and Sec. 25.337, the yawing maneuvers prescribed in Sec.
25.351, and the vertical and later gust conditions prescribed in Sec.

setting; and
(b) If the device has automatic operating or load limiting features, the
airplane must be designed for the maneuver and gust conditions prescribed in
paragraph (a) of this section, at the speeds and corresponding device
positions that the mechanism allows.

(c) of this section, are assumed to act at the appropriate control grips or
pads (in a manner simulating flight conditions) and to be reacted at the
attachment of the control system to the control surface horn.
(b) Pilot effort effects. In the control surface flight loading condition,
the air loads on movable surfaces and the corresponding deflections need not
exceed those that would result in flight from the application of any pilot
force within the ranges specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Two-
thirds of the maximum values specified for the aileron and elevator may be
used if control surface hinge moments are based on reliable data. In applying
this criterion, the effects of servo mechanisms, tabs, and automatic pilot
systems, must be considered.
(c) Limit pilot forces and torques. The limit pilot forces and torques are
as follows:

obtained under Sec. 25.395.






Sec. 25.405  Secondary control system.

Sec. 25.407  Trim tab effects.

The effects of trim tabs on the control surface design conditions must be
accounted for only where the surface loads are limited by maximum pilot
effort. In these cases, the tabs are considered to be deflected in the
direction that would assist the pilot, and the deflections are--
(a) For elevator trim tabs, those required to trim the airplane at any
point within the positive portion of the pertinent flight envelope in Sec.
25.333(b), except as limited by the stops; and
(b) For aileron and rudder trim tabs, those required to trim the airplane
in the critical unsymmetrical power and loading conditions, with appropriate
allowance for rigging tolerances.






Sec. 25.409  Tabs.

(a) Trim tabs. Trim tabs must be designed to withstand loads arising from
all likely combinations of tab setting, primary control position, and
airplane speed (obtainable without exceeding the flight load conditions
prescribed for the airplane as a whole), when the effect of the tab is
opposed by pilot effort forces up to those specified in Sec. 25.397(b).
(b) Balancing tabs. Balancing tabs must be designed for deflections
consistent with the primary control surface loading conditions.
(c) Servo tabs. Servo tabs must be designed for deflections consistent with
the primary control surface loading conditions obtainable within the pilot
maneuvering effort, considering possible opposition from the trim tabs.

locks, and the parts of the systems (if any) between these stops and locks

Sec. 25.427  Unsymmetrical loads.

(a) In designing the airplane for lateral gust, yaw maneuver and roll
maneuver conditions, account must be taken of unsymmetrical loads on the
empennage arising from effects such as slipstream and aerodynamic
interference with the wing, vertical fin and other aerodynamic surfaces.
(b) The horizontal tail must be assumed to be subjected to unsymmetrical
loading conditions determined as follows:
(1) 100 percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical maneuver
conditions of Sec. 25.331 and the vertical gust conditions of Sec. 25.341(a)
acting separately on the surface on one side of the plane of symmetry; and
(2) 80 percent of these loadings acting on the other side.
(c) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces have
dihedral angles greater than plus or minus 10 degrees, or are supported by
the vertical tail surfaces, the surfaces and the supporting structure must be
designed for gust velocities specified in Sec. 25.341(a) acting in any
orientation at right angles to the flight path.
(d) Unsymmetrical loading on the empennage arising from buffet conditions
of Sec. 25.305(e) must be taken into account.

(a) When significant, the aerodynamic influence between auxiliary
aerodynamic surfaces, such as outboard fins and winglets, and their
supporting aerodynamic surfaces, must be taken into account for all loading
conditions including pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers, and gusts as specified
in Sec. 25.341(a) acting at any orientation at right angles to the flight
path.
(b) To provide for unsymmetrical loading when outboard fins extend above
and below the horizontal surface, the critical vertical surface loading (load
per unit area) determined under Sec. 25.391 must also be applied as follows:
(1) 100 percent to the area of the vertical surfaces above (or below) the
horizontal surface.
(2) 80 percent to the area below (or above) the horizontal surface.

The loading for special devices using aerodynamic surfaces (such as slots,
slats, and spoilers) must be determined from test data.

                        Ground Loads


Sec. 25.471  General.

(a) Loads and equilibrium. For limit ground loads--
(1) Limit ground loads obtained under this subpart are considered to be
external forces applied to the airplane structure; and
(2) In each specified ground load condition, the external loads must be
placed in equilibrium with the linear and angular inertia loads in a rational
or conservative manner.
(b) Critical centers of gravity. The critical centers of gravity within the
range for which certification is requested must be selected so that the
maximum design loads are obtained in each landing gear element. Fore and aft,
vertical, and lateral airplane centers of gravity must be considered. Lateral
displacements of the c.g. from the airplane centerline which would result in
main gear loads not greater than 103 percent of the critical design load for
symmetrical loading conditions may be selected without considering the
effects of these lateral c.g. displacements on the loading of the main gear
elements, or on the airplane structure provided--
(1) The lateral displacement of the c.g. results from random passenger or
cargo disposition within the fuselage or from random unsymmetrical fuel
loading or fuel usage; and
(2) Appropriate loading instructions for random disposable loads are
included under the provisions of Sec. 25.1583(c)(1) to ensure that the
lateral displacement of the center of gravity is maintained within these
limits.

landing gear dimension data.

(1) In the attitudes defined in Sec. 25.479 and Sec. 25.481;
(2) With a limit descent velocity of 10 fps at the design landing weight
(the maximum weight for landing conditions at maximum descent velocity); and
(3) With a limit descent velocity of 6 fps at the design take-off weight
(the maximum weight for landing conditions at a reduced descent velocity).
(4) The prescribed descent velocities may be modified if it is shown that
the airplane has design features that make it impossible to develop these
velocities.
(b) Airplane lift, not exceeding airplane weight, may be assumed unless
the presence of systems or procedures significantly affects the lift.
(c) The method of analysis of airplane and landing gear loads must take
into account at least the following elements:
(1) Landing gear dynamic characteristics.
(2) Spin-up and springback.
(3) Rigid body response.
(4) Structural dynamic response of the airframe, if significant.
(d) The limit inertia load factors corresponding to the required limit
descent velocities must be validated by tests as defined in Sec. 25.723(a).
(e) The coefficient of friction between the tires and the ground may be
established by considering the effects of skidding velocity and tire
pressure. However, this coefficient of friction need not be more than 0.8.

Sec. 25.477  Landing gear arrangement.

Sections 25.479 through 25.485 apply to airplanes with conventional
arrangements of main and nose gears, or main and tail gears, when normal
operating techniques are used.



Sec. 25.479   Level landing conditions.

(a) In the level attitude, the airplane is assumed to contact the ground at
forward velocity components, ranging from VL1 to 1.25 VL2 parallel to the
ground under the conditions prescribed in Sec. 25.473 with--
(1) VL1 equal to VS0 (TAS) at the appropriate landing weight and in
standard sea level conditions; and
(2) VL2 equal to VS0 (TAS) at the appropriate landing weight and altitudes
in a hot day temperature of 41 degrees F. above standard.
(3) The effects of increased contact speed must be investigated if approval
of downwind landings exceeding 10 knots is requested.
(b) For the level landing attitude for airplanes with tail wheels, the
conditions specified in this section must be investigated with the airplane
horizontal reference line horizontal in accordance with Figure 2 of Appendix
A of this part.
(c) For the level landing attitude for airplanes with nose wheels, shown in
Figure 2 of Appendix A of this part, the conditions specified in this section
must be investigated assuming the following attitudes:
(1) An attitude in which the main wheels are assumed to contact the ground
with the nose wheel just clear of the ground; and
(2) If reasonably attainable at the specified descent and forward
velocities, an attitude in which the nose and main wheels are assumed to
contact the ground simultaneously.
(d) In addition to the loading conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of
this section, but with maximum vertical ground reactions calculated from
paragraph (a), the following apply:
(1) The landing gear and directly affected attaching structure must be
designed for the maximum vertical ground reaction combined with an aft acting
drag component of not less than 25% of this maximum vertical ground reaction.
(2) The most severe combination of loads that are likely to arise during a
lateral drift landing must be taken into account. In absence of a more
rational analysis of this condition, the following must be investigated:
(i) A vertical load equal to 75% of the maximum ground reaction of Sec.
25.473 must be considered in combination with a drag and side load of 40% and
25% respectively of that vertical load.
(ii) The shock absorber and tire deflections must be assumed to be 75% of
the deflection corresponding to the maximum ground reaction of Sec.
25.473(a)(2). This load case need not be considered in combination with flat
tires.
(3) The combination of vertical and drag components is considered to be
acting at the wheel axle centerline.

(1) and (3) is considered to be acting at the main wheel axle centerline.
(b) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with tail wheels, the
main and tail wheels are assumed to contact the ground simultaneously, in
accordance with figure 3 of Appendix A. Ground reaction conditions on the
tail wheel are assumed to act--
(1) Vertically; and
(2) Up and aft through the axle at 45 degrees to the ground line.
(c) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with nose wheels, the
airplane is assumed to be at an attitude corresponding to either the stalling
angle or the maximum angle allowing clearance with the ground by each part of
the airplane other than the main wheels, in accordance with figure 3 of
Appendix A, whichever is less.

Sec. 25.483   One-gear landing conditions.

For the one-gear landing conditions, the airplane is assumed to be in the
level attitude and to contact the ground on one main landing gear, in
accordance with Figure 4 of Appendix A of this part. In this attitude--
(a) The ground reactions must be the same as those obtained on that side
under Sec. 25.479(d)(1), and
(b) Each unbalanced external load must be reacted by airplane inertia in a
rational or conservative manner.

FR 40705, July 29, 1997]



Sec. 25.485  Side load conditions.

In addition to Sec. 25.479(d)(2) the following conditions must be
considered:
(a) For the side load condition, the airplane is assumed to be in the level
attitude with only the main wheels contacting the ground, in accordance with
figure 5 of Appendix A.
(b) Side loads of 0.8 of the vertical reaction (on one side) acting inward
and 0.6 of the vertical reaction (on the other side) acting outward must be
combined with one-half of the maximum vertical ground reactions obtained in
the level landing conditions. These loads are assumed to be applied at the
ground contact point and to be resisted by the inertia of the airplane. The
drag loads may be assumed to be zero.

FR 40705, July 29, 1997]




Sec. 25.487  Rebound landing condition.

(a) The landing gear and its supporting structure must be investigated for
the loads occurring during rebound of the airplane from the landing surface.
(b) With the landing gear fully extended and not in contact with the
ground, a load factor of 20.0 must act on the unsprung weights of the landing
gear. This load factor must act in the direction of motion of the unsprung
weights as they reach their limiting positions in extending with relation to
the sprung parts of the landing gear.






Sec. 25.489  Ground handling conditions.

Unless otherwise prescribed, the landing gear and airplane structure must
be investigated for the conditions in Secs. 25.491 through 25.509 with the
airplane at the design ramp weight (the maximum weight for ground handling
conditions). No wing lift may be considered. The shock absorbers and tires
may be assumed to be in their static position.

5673, Apr. 8, 1970]






Sec. 25.491   Taxi, takeoff and landing roll.

Within the range of appropriate ground speeds and approved weights, the
airplane structure and landing gear are assumed to be subjected to loads not
less than those obtained when the aircraft is operating over the roughest
ground that may reasonably be expected in normal operation.

[Amdt. 25-91, 62 FR 40705, July 29, 1997]


Sec. 25.493  Braked roll conditions.

(a) An airplane with a tail wheel is assumed to be in the level attitude
with the load on the main wheels, in accordance with figure 6 of Appendix A.
The limit vertical load factor is 1.2 at the design landing weight and 1.0 at
the design ramp weight. A drag reaction equal to the vertical reaction
multiplied by a coefficient of friction of 0.8, must be combined with the
vertical ground reaction and applied at the ground contact point.
(b) For an airplane with a nose wheel the limit vertical load factor is 1.2
at the design landing weight, and 1.0 at the design ramp weight. A drag
reaction equal to the vertical reaction, multiplied by a coefficient of
friction of 0.8, must be combined with the vertical reaction and applied at
the ground contact point of each wheel with brakes. The following two
attitudes, in accordance with figure 6 of Appendix A, must be considered:
(1) The level attitude with the wheels contacting the ground and the loads
distributed between the main and nose gear. Zero pitching acceleration is
assumed.
(2) The level attitude with only the main gear contacting the ground and
with the pitching moment resisted by angular acceleration.
(c) A drag reaction lower than that prescribed in this section may be used
if it is substantiated that an effective drag force of 0.8 times the vertical
reaction cannot be attained under any likely loading condition.
(d) An airplane equipped with a nose gear must be designed to withstand the
loads arising from the dynamic pitching motion of the airplane due to sudden
application of maximum braking force. The airplane is considered to be at
design takeoff weight with the nose and main gears in contact with the
ground, and with a steady-state vertical load factor of 1.0. The steady-state
nose gear reaction must be combined with the maximum incremental nose gear
vertical reaction caused by the sudden application of maximum braking force
as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(e) In the absence of a more rational analysis, the nose gear vertical
reaction prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section must be calculated
according to the following formula:

                     [ ...Illustration appears here... ]

Where:

VN=Nose gear vertical reaction.

WT=Design takeoff weight.

A=Horizontal distance between the c.g. of the airplane and the nose wheel.
B=Horizontal distance between the c.g. of the airplane and the line joining
the centers of the main wheels.
E=Vertical height of the c.g. of the airplane above the ground in the 1.0 g
static condition.
<mu>=Coefficient of friction of 0.80.
f=Dynamic response factor; 2.0 is to be used unless a lower factor is
substantiated. In the absence of other information, the dynamic response
factor f may be defined by the equation:

                     [ ...Illustration appears here... ]

Where:

j  is the effective critical damping ratio of the rigid body pitching mode
about the main landing gear effective ground contact point.

5673, Apr. 8, 1970; Amdt. 25-97, 63 FR 29072, May 27, 1998]



Sec. 25.495  Turning.

In the static position, in accordance with figure 7 of Appendix A, the
airplane is assumed to execute a steady turn by nose gear steering, or by
application of sufficient differential power, so that the limit load factors
applied at the center of gravity are 1.0 vertically and 0.5 laterally. The
side ground reaction of each wheel must be 0.5 of the vertical reaction.




Sec. 25.497  Tail-wheel yawing.

(a) A vertical ground reaction equal to the static load on the tail wheel,
in combination with a side component of equal magnitude, is assumed.
(b) If there is a swivel, the tail wheel is assumed to be swiveled 90 deg.
to the airplane longitudinal axis with the resultant load passing through the
axle.
(c) If there is a lock, steering device, or shimmy damper the tail wheel is
also assumed to be in the trailing position with the side load acting at the
ground contact point.






Sec. 25.499   Nose-wheel yaw and steering.

(a) A vertical load factor of 1.0 at the airplane center of gravity, and a
side component at the nose wheel ground contact equal to 0.8 of the vertical
ground reaction at that point are assumed.
(b) With the airplane assumed to be in static equilibrium with the loads
resulting from the use of brakes on one side of the main landing gear, the
nose gear, its attaching structure, and the fuselage structure forward of the
center of gravity must be designed for the following loads:
(1) A vertical load factor at the center of gravity of 1.0.
(2) A forward acting load at the airplane center of gravity of 0.8 times
the vertical load on one main gear.
(3) Side and vertical loads at the ground contact point on the nose gear
that are required for static equilibrium.
(4) A side load factor at the airplane center of gravity of zero.
(c) If the loads prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section result in a
nose gear side load higher than 0.8 times the vertical nose gear load, the
design nose gear side load may be limited to 0.8 times the vertical load,
with unbalanced yawing moments assumed to be resisted by airplane inertia
forces.
(d) For other than the nose gear, its attaching structure, and the forward
fuselage structure, the loading conditions are those prescribed in paragraph
(b) of this section, except that--
(1) A lower drag reaction may be used if an effective drag force of 0.8
times the vertical reaction cannot be reached under any likely loading
condition; and
(2) The forward acting load at the center of gravity need not exceed the
maximum drag reaction on one main gear, determined in accordance with Sec.
25.493(b).
(e) With the airplane at design ramp weight, and the nose gear in any
steerable position, the combined application of full normal steering torque
and vertical force equal to 1.33 times the maximum static reaction on the
nose gear must be considered in designing the nose gear, its attaching
structure, and the forward fuselage structure.

40705, July 29, 1997]


Sec. 25.503  Pivoting.

(a) The airplane is assumed to pivot about one side of the main gear with
the brakes on that side locked. The limit vertical load factor must be 1.0
and the coefficient of friction 0.8.
(b) The airplane is assumed to be in static equilibrium, with the loads
being applied at the ground contact points, in accordance with figure 8 of
Appendix A.



Sec. 25.507  Reversed braking.

(a) The airplane must be in a three point static ground attitude.
Horizontal reactions parallel to the ground and directed forward must be
applied at the ground contact point of each wheel with brakes. The limit
loads must be equal to 0.55 times the vertical load at each wheel or to the
load developed by 1.2 times the nominal maximum static brake torque,
whichever is less.
(b) For airplanes with nose wheels, the pitching moment must be balanced by
rotational inertia.
(c) For airplanes with tail wheels, the resultant of the ground reactions
must pass through the center of gravity of the airplane.


Sec. 25.509  Towing loads.

(a) The towing loads specified in paragraph (d) of this section must be
considered separately. These loads must be applied at the towing fittings and
must act parallel to the ground. In addition--
(1) A vertical load factor equal to 1.0 must be considered acting at the
center of gravity;
(2) The shock struts and tires must be in their static positions; and
(3) With WT as the design ramp weight, the towing load, FTOW, is--
(i) 0.3 WT for WT less than 30,000 pounds;
(ii) (6WT+450,000)/7 for WT between 30,000 and 100,000 pounds; and
(iii) 0.15 WT for WT over 100,000 pounds.
(b) For towing points not on the landing gear but near the plane of
symmetry of the airplane, the drag and side tow load components specified for
the auxiliary gear apply. For towing points located outboard of the main
gear, the drag and side tow load components specified for the main gear
apply. Where the specified angle of swivel cannot be reached, the maximum
obtainable angle must be used.
(c) The towing loads specified in paragraph (d) of this section must be
reacted as follows:
(1) The side component of the towing load at the main gear must be reacted
by a side force at the static ground line of the wheel to which the load is
applied.
(2) The towing loads at the auxiliary gear and the drag components of the
towing loads at the main gear must be reacted as follows:
(i) A reaction with a maximum value equal to the vertical reaction must be
applied at the axle of the wheel to which the load is applied. Enough
airplane inertia to achieve equilibrium must be applied.
(ii) The loads must be reacted by airplane inertia.
(d) The prescribed towing loads are as follows:

                                           Load

Sec. 25.511  Ground load: unsymmetrical loads on multiple-wheel units.

(a) General. Multiple-wheel landing gear units are assumed to be subjected
to the limit ground loads prescribed in this subpart under paragraphs (b)
through (f) of this section. In addition--
(1) A tandem strut gear arrangement is a multiple-wheel unit; and
(2) In determining the total load on a gear unit with respect to the
provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, the transverse
shift in the load centroid, due to unsymmetrical load distribution on the
wheels, may be neglected.
(b) Distribution of limit loads to wheels; tires inflated. The distribution
of the limit loads among the wheels of the landing gear must be established
for each landing, taxiing, and ground handling condition, taking into account
the effects of the following factors:
(1) The number of wheels and their physical arrangements. For truck type
landing gear units, the effects of any seesaw motion of the truck during the
landing impact must be considered in determining the maximum design loads for
the fore and aft wheel pairs.
(2) Any differentials in tire diameters resulting from a combination of
manufacturing tolerances, tire growth, and tire wear. A maximum tire-diameter
differential equal to 2/3  of the most unfavorable combination of diameter
variations that is obtained when taking into account manufacturing
tolerances, tire growth, and tire wear, may be assumed.
(3) Any unequal tire inflation pressure, assuming the maximum variation to
be +/-5 percent of the nominal tire inflation pressure.
(4) A runway crown of zero and a runway crown having a convex upward shape
that may be approximated by a slope of 1   percent with the horizontal.
Runway crown effects must be considered with the nose gear unit on either
slope of the crown.
(5) The airplane attitude.
(6) Any structural deflections.
(c) Deflated tires. The effect of deflated tires on the structure must be
considered with respect to the loading conditions specified in paragraphs (d)
through (f) of this section, taking into account the physical arrangement of
the gear components. In addition--
(1) The deflation of any one tire for each multiple wheel landing gear
unit, and the deflation of any two critical tires for each landing gear unit
using four or more wheels per unit, must be considered; and
(2) The ground reactions must be applied to the wheels with inflated tires
except that, for multiple-wheel gear units with more than one shock strut, a
rational distribution of the ground reactions between the deflated and
inflated tires, accounting for the differences in shock strut extensions
resulting from a deflated tire, may be used.
(d) Landing conditions. For one and for two deflated tires, the applied
load to each gear unit is assumed to be 60 percent and 50 percent,
respectively, of the limit load applied to each gear for each of the
prescribed landing conditions. However, for the drift landing condition of
Sec. 25.485, 100 percent of the vertical load must be applied.
(e) Taxiing and ground handling conditions.  For one and for two deflated
tires--
(1) The applied side or drag load factor, or both factors, at the center of
gravity must be the most critical value up to 50 percent and 40 percent,
respectively, of the limit side or drag load factors, or both factors,
corresponding to the most severe condition resulting from consideration of
the prescribed taxiing and ground handling conditions;
(2) For the braked roll conditions of Sec. 25.493 (a) and (b)(2), the drag
loads on each inflated tire may not be less than those at each tire for the
symmetrical load distribution with no deflated tires;
(3) The vertical load factor at the center of gravity must be 60 percent
and 50 percent, respectively, of the factor with no deflated tires, except
that it may not be less than 1g; and
(4) Pivoting need not be considered.
(f) Towing conditions. For one and for two deflated tires, the towing load,
FTOW, must be 60 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of the load
prescribed.






Sec. 25.519  Jacking and tie-down provisions.

(a) General. The airplane must be designed to withstand the limit load
conditions resulting from the static ground load conditions of paragraph (b)
of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this section at the most
critical combinations of airplane weight and center of gravity. The maximum
allowable load at each jack pad must be specified.
(b) Jacking. The airplane must have provisions for jacking and must
withstand the following limit loads when the airplane is supported on jacks--
(1) For jacking by the landing gear at the maximum ramp weight of the
airplane, the airplane structure must be designed for a vertical load of 1.33
times the vertical static reaction at each jacking point acting singly and in
combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction
applied in any direction.
(2) For jacking by other airplane structure at maximum approved jacking
weight:
(i) The airplane structure must be designed for a vertical load of 1.33
times the vertical reaction at each jacking point acting singly and in
combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction
applied in any direction.
(ii) The jacking pads and local structure must be designed for a vertical
load of 2.0 times the vertical static reaction at each jacking point, acting
singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical
static reaction applied in any direction.
(c) Tie-down. If tie-down points are provided, the main tie-down points and

horizontal wind from any direction.

                         Water Loads






Sec. 25.521  General.

(a) Seaplanes must be designed for the water loads developed during takeoff
and landing, with the seaplane in any attitude likely to occur in normal
operation, and at the appropriate forward and sinking velocities under the
most severe sea conditions likely to be encountered.
(b) Unless a more rational analysis of the water loads is made, or the
standards in ANC-3 are used, Secs. 25.523 through 25.537 apply.
(c) The requirements of this section and Secs. 25.523 through 25.537 apply
also to amphibians.






Sec. 25.523  Design weights and center of gravity positions.

(a) Design weights. The water load requirements must be met at each
operating weight up to the design landing weight except that, for the takeoff
condition prescribed in Sec. 25.531, the design water takeoff weight (the
maximum weight for water taxi and takeoff run) must be used.
(b) Center of gravity positions. The critical centers of gravity within the
limits for which certification is requested must be considered to reach
maximum design loads for each part of the seaplane structure.

5673, Apr. 8, 1970]






Sec. 25.525  Application of loads.

(a) Unless otherwise prescribed, the seaplane as a whole is assumed to be
subjected to the loads corresponding to the load factors specified in Sec.
25.527.
(b) In applying the loads resulting from the load factors prescribed in
Sec. 25.527, the loads may be distributed over the hull or main float bottom
(in order to avoid excessive local shear loads and bending moments at the
location of water load application) using pressures not less than those
prescribed in Sec. 25.533(b).
(c) For twin float seaplanes, each float must be treated as an equivalent
hull on a fictitious seaplane with a weight equal to one-half the weight of
the twin float seaplane.
(d) Except in the takeoff condition of Sec. 25.531, the aerodynamic lift on
the seaplane during the impact is assumed to be 2/3  of the weight of the
seaplane.






Sec. 25.527  Hull and main float load factors.

(a) Water reaction load factors nW must be computed in the following
manner:
(1) For the step landing case

                         C1VS02
                   nw =  ----------------
                         (Tan2/3 b)W1/3

(2) For the bow and stern landing cases

                   C1VS02               K1
             nw =  ----------------  x  ----------
                   (Tan2/3 b)W1/3       (1+rx2)2/3

(b) The following values are used:
(1) nW=water reaction load factor (that is, the water reaction divided by
seaplane weight).
(2) C1=empirical seaplane operations factor equal to 0.012 (except that
this factor may not be less than that necessary to obtain the minimum value
of step load factor of 2.33).
(3) VS0=seaplane stalling speed in knots with flaps extended in the
appropriate landing position and with no slipstream effect.
(4) <beta>=angle of dead rise at the longitudinal station at which the load
factor is being determined in accordance with figure 1 of Appendix B.
(5) W=seaplane design landing weight in pounds.
(6) K1=empirical hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2
of Appendix B.
(7) rx=ratio of distance, measured parallel to hull reference axis, from
the center of gravity of the seaplane to the hull longitudinal station at
which the load factor is being computed to the radius of gyration in pitch of
the seaplane, the hull reference axis being a straight line, in the plane of
symmetry, tangential to the keel at the main step.
(c) For a twin float seaplane, because of the effect of flexibility of the
attachment of the floats to the seaplane, the factor K1 may be reduced at the
bow and stern to 0.8 of the value shown in figure 2 of Appendix B. This
reduction applies only to the design of the carrythrough and seaplane
structure.

Sec. 25.529  Hull and main float landing conditions.

(a) Symmetrical step, bow, and stern landing. For symmetrical step, bow,
and stern landings, the limit water reaction load factors are those computed
under Sec. 25.527. In addition--
(1) For symmetrical step landings, the resultant water load must be applied
at the keel, through the center of gravity, and must be directed
perpendicularly to the keel line;
(2) For symmetrical bow landings, the resultant water load must be applied
at the keel, one-fifth of the longitudinal distance from the bow to the step,
and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line; and
(3) For symmetrical stern landings, the resultant water load must be
applied at the keel, at a point 85 percent of the longitudinal distance from
the step to the stern post, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel
line.
(b) Unsymmetrical landing for hull and single float seaplanes.
Unsymmetrical step, bow, and stern landing conditions must be investigated.
In addition--
(1) The loading for each condition consists of an upward component and a
side component equal, respectively, to 0.75 and 0.25 tan <beta> times the
resultant load in the corresponding symmetrical landing condition; and
(2) The point of application and direction of the upward component of the
load is the same as that in the symmetrical condition, and the point of
application of the side component is at the same longitudinal station as the
upward component but is directed inward perpendicularly to the plane of
symmetry at a point midway between the keel and chine lines.
(c) Unsymmetrical landing; twin float seaplanes. The unsymmetrical loading
consists of an upward load at the step of each float of 0.75 and a side load
of 0.25 tan <beta> at one float times the step landing load reached under
Sec. 25.527. The side load is directed inboard, perpendicularly to the plane
of symmetry midway between the keel and chine lines of the float, at the same
longitudinal station as the upward load.






Sec. 25.531  Hull and main float takeoff condition.

For the wing and its attachment to the hull or main float--
(a) The aerodynamic wing lift is assumed to be zero; and
(b) A downward inertia load, corresponding to a load factor computed from
the following formula, must be applied:

                         CTOVS12
                    n =  ----------------
                         (tan2/3 b)W1/3

where--

n= inertia load factor;
CTO=empirical seaplane operations factor equal to 0.004;
VS1=seaplane stalling speed (knots) at the design takeoff weight with the
flaps extended in the appropriate takeoff position;
<beta>=angle of dead rise at the main step (degrees); and
W=design water takeoff weight in pounds.

Sec. 25.533  Hull and main float bottom pressures.

(a) General. The hull and main float structure, including frames and
bulkheads, stringers, and bottom plating, must be designed under this
section.
(b) Local pressures. For the design of the bottom plating and stringers and
their attachments to the supporting structure, the following pressure
distributions must be applied:
(1) For an unflared bottom, the pressure at the chine is 0.75 times the
pressure at the keel, and the pressures between the keel and chine vary
linearly, in accordance with figure 3 of Appendix B. The pressure at the keel
(psi) is computed as follows:

                                 K2VS12
                      Pk = C2 x  ------
                                 tan bk

where--

Pk=pressure (p.s.i.) at the keel;
C2=0.00213;
K2=hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2 of Appendix B;
VS1= seaplane stalling speed (Knots) at the design water takeoff weight with
flaps extended in the appropriate takeoff position; and
<beta>k=angle of dead rise at keel, in accordance with figure 1 of Appendix
B.

(2) For a flared bottom, the pressure at the beginning of the flare is the
same as that for an unflared bottom, and the pressure between the chine and
the beginning of the flare varies linearly, in accordance with figure 3 of
Appendix B. The pressure distribution is the same as that prescribed in
paragraph (b)(1) of this section for an unflared bottom except that the
pressure at the chine is computed as follows:

                                 K2VS12
                     Pch = C3 x  ------
                                 tan b

where--

Pch=pressure (p.s.i.) at the chine;
C3=0.0016;
K2=hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2 of Appendix B;
VS1= seaplane stalling speed at the design water takeoff weight with flaps
extended in the appropriate takeoff position; and
<beta>= angle of dead rise at appropriate station.

The area over which these pressures are applied must simulate pressures
occurring during high localized impacts on the hull or float, but need not
extend over an area that would induce critical stresses in the frames or in
the overall structure.
(c) Distributed pressures. For the design of the frames, keel, and chine
structure, the following pressure distributions apply:
(1) Symmetrical pressures are computed as follows:

                                K2VS02
                      P = C4 x  ------
                                tan b

where--

P =pressure (p.s.i.);
C4 =0.078 C1 (with C1 computed under Sec. 25.527);
K2 =hull station weighing factor, determined in accordance with figure 2 of
Appendix B;
VS0 =seaplane stalling speed (Knots) with landing flaps extended in the
appropriate position and with no slipstream effect; and
VS0 =seaplane stalling speed with landing flaps extended in the appropriate
position and with no slipstream effect; and <beta>=angle of dead rise at
appropriate station.

(2) The unsymmetrical pressure distribution consists of the pressures
prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on one side of the hull or
main float centerline and one-half of that pressure on the other side of the
hull or main float centerline, in accordance with figure 3 of Appendix B.

These pressures are uniform and must be applied simultaneously over the
entire hull or main float bottom. The loads obtained must be carried into the
sidewall structure of the hull proper, but need not be transmitted in a fore
and aft direction as shear and bending loads.

5673, Apr. 8, 1970]






Sec. 25.535  Auxiliary float loads.

(a) General. Auxiliary floats and their attachments and supporting
structures must be designed for the conditions prescribed in this section. In
the cases specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, the
prescribed water loads may be distributed over the float bottom to avoid
excessive local loads, using bottom pressures not less than those prescribed
in paragraph (g) of this section.
(b) Step loading. The resultant water load must be applied in the plane of
symmetry of the float at a point three-fourths of the distance from the bow
to the step and must be perpendicular to the keel. The resultant limit load
is computed as follows, except that the value of L need not exceed three
times the weight of the displaced water when the float is completely
submerged:

         C5   VSO**2  W 2/3
   L= -----------------------------------
      tan 2/3 <beta>S (1 + ry**2) **2/3

where--

L =limit load (lbs.);
C5 =0.0053;
VS0 =seaplane stalling speed (knots) with landing flaps extended in the
appropriate position and with no slipstream effect;
W =seaplane design landing weight in pounds;
<beta>S=angle of dead rise at a station 3/4  of the distance from the bow to
the step, but need not be less than 15 degrees; and
ry=ratio of the lateral distance between the center of gravity and the plane
of symmetry of the float to the radius of gyration in roll.

(c) Bow loading. The resultant limit load must be applied in the plane of
symmetry of the float at a point one-fourth of the distance from the bow to
the step and must be perpendicular to the tangent to the keel line at that
point. The magnitude of the resultant load is that specified in paragraph (b)
of this section.
(d) Unsymmetrical step loading. The resultant water load consists of a
component equal to 0.75 times the load specified in paragraph (a) of this
section and a side component equal to 3.25 tan <beta> times the load
specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The side load must be applied
perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry of the float at a point midway
between the keel and the chine.
(e) Unsymmetrical bow loading. The resultant water load consists of a
component equal to 0.75 times the load specified in paragraph (b) of this
section and a side component equal to 0.25 tan <beta> times the load
specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The side load must be applied
perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry at a point midway between the keel
and the chine.
(f) Immersed float condition. The resultant load must be applied at the
centroid of the cross section of the float at a point one-third of the
distance from the bow to the step. The limit load components are as follows:

vertical = <rho>gVSO

aft = Cx2 <rho>V**2/3 (KVSO)**2.

side = Cy2 <rho>V**2/3 (KVSO)**2.

where--

<rho>=mass density of water (slugs/ft.2);
V =volume of float (ft.2);
Cx =coefficient of drag force, equal to 0.133;
Cy =coefficient of side force, equal to 0.106;
K =0.8, except that lower values may be used if it is shown that the floats
are incapable of submerging at a speed of 0.8 VS0 in normal operations;
VS0 =seaplane stalling speed (knots) with landing flaps extended in the
appropriate position and with no slipstream effect; and
g =acceleration due to gravity (ft./sec.2).

(g) Float bottom pressures. The float bottom pressures must be established
under Sec. 25.533, except that the value of K2 in the formulae may be taken
as 1.0. The angle of dead rise to be used in determining the float bottom
pressures is set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

                Emergency Landing Conditions



Sec. 25.561  General.

(a) The airplane, although it may be damaged in emergency landing
conditions on land or water, must be designed as prescribed in this section
to protect each occupant under those conditions.
(b) The structure must be designed to give each occupant every reasonable
chance of escaping serious injury in a minor crash landing when--
(1) Proper use is made of seats, belts, and all other safety design
provisions;
(2) The wheels are retracted (where applicable); and
(3) The occupant experiences the following ultimate inertia forces acting
separately relative to the surrounding structure:
(i) Upward, 3.0g
(ii) Forward, 9.0g
(iii) Sideward, 3.0g on the airframe; and 4.0g on the seats and their
attachments.
(iv) Downward, 6.0g
(v) Rearward, 1.5g
(c) For equipment, cargo in the passenger compartments and any other large
masses, the following apply:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, these items
must be positioned so that if they break loose they will be unlikely to:
(i) Cause direct injury to occupants;
(ii) Penetrate fuel tanks or lines or cause fire or explosion hazard by
damage to adjacent systems; or
(iii) Nullify any of the escape facilities provided for use after an
emergency landing.
(2) When such positioning is not practical (e.g. fuselage mounted engines
or auxiliary power units) each such item of mass shall be restrained under
all loads up to those specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The
local attachments for these items should be designed to withstand 1.33 times
the specified loads if these items are subject to severe wear and tear
through frequent removal (e.g. quick change interior items).
(d) Seats and items of mass (and their supporting structure) must not
deform under any loads up to those specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this
section in any manner that would impede subsequent rapid evacuation of
occupants.

FR 40706, July 29, 1997]



Sec. 25.562  Emergency landing dynamic conditions.

(a) The seat and restraint system in the airplane must be designed as
prescribed in this section to protect each occupant during an emergency
landing condition when--
(1) Proper use is made of seats, safety belts, and shoulder harnesses
provided for in the design; and
(2) The occupant is exposed to loads resulting from the conditions
prescribed in this section.
(b) Each seat type design approved for crew or passenger occupancy during
takeoff and landing must successfully complete dynamic tests or be
demonstrated by rational analysis based on dynamic tests of a similar type
seat, in accordance with each of the following emergency landing conditions.
The tests must be conducted with an occupant simulated by a 170-pound
anthropomorphic test dummy, as defined by 49 CFR Part 572, Subpart B, or its
equivalent, sitting in the normal upright position.
(1) A change in downward vertical velocity (Dv) of not less than 35 feet
per second, with the airplane's longitudinal axis canted downward 30 degrees
with respect to the horizontal plane and with the wings level. Peak floor
deceleration must occur in not more than 0.08 seconds after impact and must
reach a minimum of 14g.
(2) A change in forward longitudinal velocity (Dv) of not less than 44 feet
per second, with the airplane's longitudinal axis horizontal and yawed 10
degrees either right or left, whichever would cause the greatest likelihood
of the upper torso restraint system (where installed) moving off the
occupant's shoulder, and with the wings level. Peak floor deceleration must
occur in not more than 0.09 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of
16g. Where floor rails or floor fittings are used to attach the seating
devices to the test fixture, the rails or fittings must be misaligned with
respect to the adjacent set of rails or fittings by at least 10 degrees
vertically (i.e., out of Parallel) with one rolled 10 degrees.
(c) The following performance measures must not be exceeded during the
dynamic tests conducted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) Where upper torso straps are used for crewmembers, tension loads in
individual straps must not exceed 1,750 pounds. If dual straps are used for
restraining the upper torso, the total strap tension loads must not exceed
2,000 pounds.
(2) The maximum compressive load measured between the pelvis and the lumbar
column of the anthropomorphic dummy must not exceed 1,500 pounds.
(3) The upper torso restraint straps (where installed) must remain on the
occupant's shoulder during the impact.
(4) The lap safety belt must remain on the occupant's pelvis during the
impact.
(5) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury under the
conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Where head contact
with seats or other structure can occur, protection must be provided so that
the head impact does not exceed a Head Injury Criterion (HIC) of 1,000 units.
The level of HIC is defined by the equation:



                      1         t22.5
HCI =     {  [  (t2-t1) [--------  I        a(t)dt ]  }
                    (t2-t1)     t1               max

Where:
t1 is the initial integration time,
t2 is the final integration time, and
a(t) is the total acceleration vs. time curve for the head strike, and where
(t) is in seconds, and (a) is in units of gravity (g).

(6) Where leg injuries may result from contact with seats or other
structure, protection must be provided to prevent axially compressive loads
exceeding 2,250 pounds in each femur.
(7) The seat must remain attached at all points of attachment, although the
structure may have yielded.
(8) Seats must not yield under the tests specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and
(b)(2) of this section to the extent they would impede rapid evacuation of
the airplane occupants.

Sec. 25.563  Structural ditching provisions.

Structural strength considerations of ditching provisions must be in
accordance with Sec. 25.801(e).



                     Fatigue Evaluation


Sec. 25.571  Damage--tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.

(a) General. An evaluation of the strength, detail design, and fabrication
must show that catastrophic failure due to fatigue, corrosion, manufacturing
defects, or accidental damage, will be avoided throughout the operational
life of the airplane. This evaluation must be conducted in accordance with
the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section, except as specified
in paragraph (c) of this section, for each part of the structure that could
contribute to a catastrophic failure (such as wing, empennage, control
surfaces and their systems, the fuselage, engine mounting, landing gear, and
their related primary attachments). For turbojet powered airplanes, those
parts that could contribute to a catastrophic failure must also be evaluated
under paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, the following apply:
(1) Each evaluation required by this section must include--
(i) The typical loading spectra, temperatures, and humidities expected in
service;
(ii) The identification of principal structural elements and detail design
points, the failure of which could cause catastrophic failure of the
airplane; and
(iii) An analysis, supported by test evidence, of the principal structural
elements and detail design points identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this
section.
(2) The service history of airplanes of similar structural design, taking
due account of differences in operating conditions and procedures, may be
used in the evaluations required by this section.
(3) Based on the evaluations required by this section, inspections or other
procedures must be established, as necessary, to prevent catastrophic
failure, and must be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the
Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by Sec. 25.1529. Inspection
thresholds for the following types of structure must be established based on
crack growth analyses and/or tests, assuming the structure contains an
initial flaw of the maximum probable size that could exist as a result of
manufacturing or service-induced damage:
(i) Single load path structure, and
(ii) Multiple load path "fail-safe" structure and crack arrest "fail-safe"
structure, where it cannot be demonstrated that load path failure, partial
failure, or crack arrest will be detected and repaired during normal
maintenance, inspection, or operation of an airplane prior to failure of the
remaining structure.
(b) Damage-tolerance evaluation. The evaluation must include a
determination of the probable locations and modes of damage due to fatigue,
corrosion, or accidental damage. Repeated load and static analyses supported
by test evidence and (if available) service experience must also be
incorporated in the evaluation. Special consideration for widespread fatigue
damage must be included where the design is such that this type of damage
could occur. It must be demonstrated with sufficient full-scale fatigue test
evidence that widespread fatigue damage will not occur within the design
service goal of the airplane. The type certificate may be issued prior to
completion of full-scale fatigue testing, provided the Administrator has
approved a plan for completing the required tests, and the airworthiness
limitations section of the instructions for continued airworthiness required
by Sec. 25.1529 of this part specifies that no airplane may be operated
beyond a number of cycles equal to   the number of cycles accumulated on
the fatigue test article, until such testing is completed. The extent of
damage for residual strength evaluation at any time within the operational
life of the airplane must be consistent with the initial detectability and
subsequent growth under repeated loads. The residual strength evaluation must
show that the remaining structure is able to withstand loads (considered as
static ultimate loads) corresponding to the following conditions:
(1) The limit symmetrical maneuvering conditions specified in Sec. 25.337
at all speeds up to Vc and in Sec. 25.345.
(1) The limit symmetrical maneuvering conditions specified in Sec. 25.337
at VC and in Sec. 25.345.
(2) The limit gust conditions specified in Sec. 25.341 at the specified
speeds up to VC and in Sec. 25.345.
(3) The limit rolling conditions specified in Sec. 25.349 and the limit
unsymmetrical conditions specified in Secs. 25.367 and 25.427 (a) through
(c), at speeds up to VC.
(4) The limit yaw maneuvering conditions specified in Sec. 25.351(a) at the
specified speeds up to VC.
(5) For pressurized cabins, the following conditions:
(i) The normal operating differential pressure combined with the expected
external aerodynamic pressures applied simultaneously with the flight loading
conditions specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section, if
they have a significant effect.
(ii) The maximum value of normal operating differential pressure (including
the expected external aerodynamic pressures during 1 g level flight)
multiplied by a factor of 1.15, omitting other loads.
(6) For landing gear and directly-affected airframe structure, the limit
ground loading conditions specified in Secs. 25.473, 25.491, and 25.493.

If significant changes in structural stiffness or geometry, or both, follow
from a structural failure, or partial failure, the effect on damage tolerance
must be further investigated.
(c) Fatigue (safe-life) evaluation. Compliance with the damage-tolerance
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is not required if the
applicant establishes that their application for particular structure is
impractical. This structure must be shown by analysis, supported by test
evidence, to be able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude
expected during its service life without detectable cracks. Appropriate safe-
life scatter factors must be applied.
(d) Sonic fatigue strength. It must be shown by analysis, supported by test
evidence, or by the service history of airplanes of similar structural design
and sonic excitation environment, that--
(1) Sonic fatigue cracks are not probable in any part of the flight
structure subject to sonic excitation; or
(2) Catastrophic failure caused by sonic cracks is not probable assuming
that the loads prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section are applied to all
areas affected by those cracks.
(e) Damage-tolerance (discrete source) evaluation. The airplane must be
capable of successfully completing a flight during which likely structural
damage occurs as a result of--
(1) Impact with a 4-pound bird when the velocity of the airplane relative
to the bird along the airplane's flight path is equal to Vc at sea level or
0.85Vc at 8,000 feet, whichever is more critical;
(2) Uncontained fan blade impact;
(3) Uncontained engine failure; or
(4) Uncontained high energy rotating machinery failure.

The damaged structure must be able to withstand the static loads (considered
as ultimate loads) which are reasonably expected to occur on the flight.
Dynamic effects on these static loads need not be considered. Corrective
action to be taken by the pilot following the incident, such as limiting
maneuvers, avoiding turbulence, and reducing speed, must be considered. If
significant changes in structural stiffness or geometry, or both, follow from

Sec. 25.611  Accessibility provisions.

Means must be provided to allow inspection (including inspection of
principal structural elements and control systems), replacement of parts
normally requiring replacement, adjustment, and lubrication as necessary for
continued airworthiness. The inspection means for each item must be
practicable for the inspection interval for the item. Nondestructive

within an assembly, the failure of which would result in loss of structural
integrity of the component, 99 percent probability with 95 percent
confidence.
(2) For redundant structure, in which the failure of individual elements
would result in applied loads being safely distributed to other load carrying
members, 90 percent probability with 95 percent confidence.
(c) The effects of temperature on allowable stresses used for design in an
essential component or structure must be considered where thermal effects are
significant under normal operating conditions.
(d) The strength, detail design, and fabrication of the structure must
minimize the probability of disastrous fatigue failure, particularly at
points of stress concentration.
(e) Greater design values may be used if a "premium selection" of the
material is made in which a specimen of each individual item is tested before
use to determine that the actual strength properties of that particular item
will equal or exceed those used in design.

Sec. 25.629   Aeroelastic stability requirements.

(a) General. The aeroelastic stability evaluations required under this
section include flutter, divergence, control reversal and any undue loss of
stability and control as a result of structural deformation. The aeroelastic
evaluation must include whirl modes associated with any propeller or rotating
device that contributes significant dynamic forces. Compliance with this
section must be shown by analyses, wind tunnel tests, ground vibration tests,
flight tests, or other means found necessary by the Administrator.
(b) Aeroelastic stability envelopes. The airplane must be designed to be
free from aeroelastic instability for all configurations and design
conditions within the aeroelastic stability envelopes as follows:
(1) For normal conditions without failures, malfunctions, or adverse
conditions, all combinations of altitudes and speeds encompassed by the VD/MD
versus altitude envelope enlarged at all points by an increase of 15 percent
in equivalent airspeed at both constant Mach number and constant altitude. In
addition, a proper margin of stability must exist at all speeds up to VD/MD
and, there must be no large and rapid reduction in stability as VD/MD is
approached. The enlarged envelope may be limited to Mach 1.0 when MD is less
than 1.0 at all design altitudes, and
(2) For the conditions described in Sec. 25.629(d) below, for all approved
altitudes, any airspeed up to the greater airspeed defined by;
(i) The VD/MD envelope determined by Sec. 25.335(b); or,
(ii) An altitude-airspeed envelope defined by a 15 percent increase in
equivalent airspeed above VC at constant altitude, from sea level to the
altitude of the intersection of 1.15 VC with the extension of the constant
cruise Mach number line, MC, then a linear variation in equivalent airspeed
to MC+.05 at the altitude of the lowest VC/MC intersection; then, at higher
altitudes, up to the maximum flight altitude, the boundary defined by a .05
Mach increase in MC at constant altitude.
(c) Balance weights. If concentrated balance weights are used, their
effectiveness and strength, including supporting structure, must be
substantiated.
(d) Failures, malfunctions, and adverse conditions. The failures,
malfunctions, and adverse conditions which must be considered in showing
compliance with this section are:
(1) Any critical fuel loading conditions, not shown to be extremely
improbable, which may result from mismanagement of fuel.
(2) Any single failure in any flutter damper system.
(3) For airplanes not approved for operation in icing conditions, the
maximum likely ice accumulation expected as a result of an inadvertent
encounter.
(4) Failure of any single element of the structure supporting any engine,
independently mounted propeller shaft, large auxiliary power unit, or large
externally mounted aerodynamic body (such as an external fuel tank).
(5) For airplanes with engines that have propellers or large rotating
devices capable of significant dynamic forces, any single failure of the
engine structure that would reduce the rigidity of the rotational axis.
(6) The absence of aerodynamic or gyroscopic forces resulting from the most
adverse combination of feathered propellers or other rotating devices capable
of significant dynamic forces. In addition, the effect of a single feathered
propeller or rotating device must be coupled with the failures of paragraphs
(d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section.
(7) Any single propeller or rotating device capable of significant dynamic
forces rotating at the highest likely overspeed.
(8) Any damage or failure condition, required or selected for investigation
by Sec. 25.571. The single structural failures described in paragraphs (d)(4)
and (d)(5) of this section need not be considered in showing compliance with
this section if;
(i) The structural element could not fail due to discrete source damage
resulting from the conditions described in Sec. 25.571(e), and
(ii) A damage tolerance investigation in accordance with Sec. 25.571(b)
shows that the maximum extent of damage assumed for the purpose of residual
strength evaluation does not involve complete failure of the structural
element.
(9) Any damage, failure, or malfunction considered under Secs. 25.631,
25.671, 25.672, and 25.1309.
(10) Any other combination of failures, malfunctions, or adverse conditions
not shown to be extremely improbable.
(e) Flight flutter testing. Full scale flight flutter tests at speeds up to
VDF/MDF must be conducted for new type designs and for modifications to a
type design unless the modifications have been shown to have an insignificant
effect on the aeroelastic stability. These tests must demonstrate that the
airplane has a proper margin of damping at all speeds up to VDF/MDF, and that
there is no large and rapid reduction in damping as VDF/MDF, is approached.
If a failure, malfunction, or adverse condition is simulated during flight
test in showing compliance with paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum
speed investigated need not exceed VFC/MFC if it is shown, by correlation of
the flight test data with other test data or analyses, that the airplane is
free from any aeroelastic instability at all speeds within the altitude-
airspeed envelope described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

[57 FR 28949, June 29, 1992]



Sec. 25.631  Bird strike damage.

The empennage structure must be designed to assure capability of continued
safe flight and landing of the airplane after impact with an 8-pound bird
when the velocity of the airplane (relative to the bird along the airplane's
flight path) is equal to VC at sea level, selected under Sec. 25.335(a).
Compliance with this section by provision of redundant structure and
protected location of control system elements or protective devices such as
splitter plates or energy absorbing material is acceptable. Where compliance
is shown by analysis, tests, or both, use of data on airplanes having similar
structural design is acceptable.

the trim requirements of Sec. 25.161.






Sec. 25.657  Hinges.

(a) For control surface hinges, including ball, roller, and self-lubricated
bearing hinges, the approved rating of the bearing may not be exceeded. For
nonstandard bearing hinge configurations, the rating must be established on
the basis of experience or tests and, in the absence of a rational
investigation, a factor of safety of not less than 6.67 must be used with
respect to the ultimate bearing strength of the softest material used as a
bearing.
(b) Hinges must have enough strength and rigidity for loads parallel to the
hinge line.

and positiveness appropriate to its function.
(b) Each element of each flight control system must be designed, or
distinctively and permanently marked, to minimize the probability of
incorrect assembly that could result in the malfunctioning of the system.
(c) The airplane must be shown by analysis, tests, or both, to be capable
of continued safe flight and landing after any of the following failures or
jamming in the flight control system and surfaces (including trim, lift,
drag, and feel systems), within the normal flight envelope, without requiring
exceptional piloting skill or strength. Probable malfunctions must have only
minor effects on control system operation and must be capable of being
readily counteracted by the pilot.
(1) Any single failure, excluding jamming (for example, disconnection or
failure of mechanical elements, or structural failure of hydraulic
components, such as actuators, control spool housing, and valves).
(2) Any combination of failures not shown to be extremely improbable,
excluding jamming (for example, dual electrical or hydraulic system failures,
or any single failure in combination with any probable hydraulic or
electrical failure).
(3) Any jam in a control position normally encountered during takeoff,
climb, cruise, normal turns, descent, and landing unless the jam is shown to
be extremely improbable, or can be alleviated. A runaway of a flight control
to an adverse position and jam must be accounted for if such runaway and
subsequent jamming is not extremely improbable.
(d) The airplane must be designed so that it is controllable if all engines
fail. Compliance with this requirement may be shown by analysis where that
method has been shown to be reliable.

operated systems is necessary to show compliance with the flight
characteristics requirements of this part, such systems must comply with Sec.
25.671 and the following:
(a) A warning which is clearly distinguishable to the pilot under expected

automatic or power-operated system must permit initial counteraction of
failures of the type specified in Sec. 25.671(c) without requiring
exceptional pilot skill or strength, by either the deactivation of the
system, or a failed portion thereof, or by overriding the failure by movement
of the flight controls in the normal sense.
(c) It must be shown that after any single failure of the stability
augmentation system or any other automatic or power-operated system--
(1) The airplane is safely controllable when the failure or malfunction
occurs at any speed or altitude within the approved operating limitations
that is critical for the type of failure being considered;
(2) The controllability and maneuverability requirements of this part are
met within a practical operational flight envelope (for example, speed,
altitude, normal acceleration, and airplane configurations) which is
described in the Airplane Flight Manual; and
(3) The trim, stability, and stall characteristics are not impaired below a
level needed to permit continued safe flight and landing.

Sec. 25.679  Control system gust locks.

(a) There must be a device to prevent damage to the control surfaces
(including tabs), and to the control system, from gusts striking the airplane
while it is on the ground or water. If the device, when engaged, prevents
normal operation of the control surfaces by the pilot, it must--

or load limiting device, without further attention by the pilots.
(b) Each lift and drag device control must be designed and located to make
inadvertent operation improbable. Lift and drag devices intended for ground
operation only must have means to prevent the inadvertent operation of their
controls in flight if that operation could be hazardous.
(c) The rate of motion of the surfaces in response to the operation of the
control and the characteristics of the automatic positioning or load limiting
device must give satisfactory flight and performance characteristics under
steady or changing conditions of airspeed, engine power, and airplane
attitude.
(d) The lift device control must be designed to retract the surfaces from
the fully extended position, during steady flight at maximum continuous
engine power at any speed below VF +9.0 (knots).

Sec. 25.699  Lift and drag device indicator.

(a) There must be means to indicate to the pilots the position of each lift
or drag device having a separate control in the cockpit to adjust its
position. In addition, an indication of unsymmetrical operation or other
malfunction in the lift or drag device systems must be provided when such
indication is necessary to enable the pilots to prevent or counteract an
unsafe flight or ground condition, considering the effects on flight
characteristics and performance.
(b) There must be means to indicate to the pilots the takeoff, en route,
approach, and landing lift device positions.
(c) If any extension of the lift and drag devices beyond the landing
position is possible, the controls must be clearly marked to identify this
range of extension.

Sec. 25.701  Flap and slat interconnection.

(a) Unless the airplane has safe flight characteristics with the flaps or
slats retracted on one side and extended on the other, the motion of flaps or
slats on opposite sides of the plane of symmetry must be synchronized by a
mechanical interconnection or approved equivalent means.
(b) If a wing flap or slat interconnection or equivalent means is used, it
must be designed to account for the applicable unsymmetrical loads, including
those resulting from flight with the engines on one side of the plane of
symmetry inoperative and the remaining engines at takeoff power.
(c) For airplanes with flaps or slats that are not subjected to slipstream
conditions, the structure must be designed for the loads imposed when the
wing flaps or slats on one side are carrying the most severe load occurring
in the prescribed symmetrical conditions and those on the other side are
carrying not more than 80 percent of that load.
(d) The interconnection must be designed for the loads resulting when
interconnected flap or slat surfaces on one side of the plane of symmetry are
jammed and immovable while the surfaces on the other side are free to move
and the full power of the surface actuating system is applied.

automatically activated during the initial portion of the takeoff roll if the
airplane is in a configuration, including any of the following, that would
not allow a safe takeoff:
(1) The wing flaps or leading edge devices are not within the approved
range of takeoff positions.
(2) Wing spoilers (except lateral control spoilers meeting the requirements
of Sec. 25.671), speed brakes, or longitudinal trim devices are in a position

(b) The warning required by paragraph (a) of this section must continue
until--
(1) The configuration is changed to allow a safe takeoff;
(2) Action is taken by the pilot to terminate the takeoff roll;
(3)  The  airplane  is  rotated  for takeoff; or

Sec. 25.721  General.

(a) The main landing gear system must be designed so that if it fails due
to overloads during takeoff and landing (assuming the overloads to act in the
upward and aft directions), the failure mode is not likely to cause--
(1) For airplanes that have passenger seating configuration, excluding
pilots seats, of nine seats or less, the spillage of enough fuel from any
fuel system in the fuselage to constitute a fire hazard; and
(2) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding
pilots seats, of 10 seats or more, the spillage of enough fuel from any part
of the fuel system to constitute a fire hazard.
(b) Each airplane that has a passenger seating configuration excluding
pilots seats, of 10 seats or more must be designed so that with the airplane
under control it can be landed on a paved runway with any one or more landing
gear legs not extended without sustaining a structural component failure that
is likely to cause the spillage of enough fuel to constitute a fire hazard.
(c) Compliance with the provisions of this section may be shown by analysis
or tests, or both.

system which has similar energy absorption characteristics may be used for
increases in previously approved takeoff and landing weights.

energy absorption capacity, simulating a descent velocity of 12 f.p.s. at
design landing weight, assuming airplane lift not greater than the airplane
weight acting during the landing impact.

Sec. 25.725  Limit drop tests.

(a) If compliance with Sec. 25.723(a) is shown by free drop tests, these
tests must be made on the complete airplane, or on units consisting of a
wheel, tire, and shock absorber, in their proper positions, from free drop
heights not less than--
(1) 18.7 inches for the design landing weight conditions; and
(2) 6.7 inches for the design takeoff weight conditions.
(b) If airplane lift is simulated by air cylinders or by other mechanical
means, the weight used for the drop must be equal to W. If the effect of
airplane lift is represented in free drop tests by an equivalent reduced
mass, the landing gear must be dropped with an effective mass equal to

                             h+(1-L)d
                   We = W x  ------------
                             h+d

where--

We= the effective weight to be used in the drop test (lbs.);
h =specified free drop height (inches);
d =deflection under impact of the tire (at the approved inflation pressure)
plus the vertical component of the axle travel relative to the drop mass
(inches);
W=WM for main gear units (lbs.), equal to the static weight on that unit with
the airplane in the level attitude (with the nose wheel clear in the case
of nose wheel type airplanes);
W=WT for tail gear units (lbs.), equal to the static weight on the tail unit
with the airplane in the tail-down attitude;
W=WN for nose wheel units (lbs.), equal to the vertical component of the
static reaction that would exist at the nose wheel, assuming that the
mass of the airplane acts at the center of gravity and exerts a force of
1.0 g downward and 0.25 g forward; and
L = ratio of the assumed airplane lift to the airplane weight, but not more
than 1.0.

(c) The drop test attitude of the landing gear unit and the application of
appropriate drag loads during the test must simulate the airplane landing
conditions in a manner consistent with the development of a rational or
conservative limit load factor value.
(d) The value of d used in the computation of We in paragraph (b) of this
section may not exceed the value actually obtained in the drop test.
(e) The limit inertia load factor n must be determined from the free drop
test in paragraph (b) of this section according to the following formula:

                              We
                      n = nj  ----  + L
                              W

where--

nj =the load factor developed in the drop test (that is, the acceleration dv/
dt in g's recorded in the drop test) plus 1.0; and
We,  W, and L are the same as in the drop test computation.

(f) The value of n determined in paragraph (e) of this section may not be
more than the limit inertia load factor used in the landing conditions in
Sec. 25.473.

Sec. 25.727  Reserve energy absorption drop tests.

(a) If compliance with the reserve energy absorption condition specified in
Sec. 25.723(b) is shown by free drop tests, the drop height may not be less
than 27 inches.
(b) If airplane lift is simulated by air cylinders or by other mechanical
means, the weight used for the drop must be equal to W. If the effect of
airplane lift is represented in free drop tests by an equivalent reduced
mass, the landing gear must be dropped with an effective mass,

                              Wh
                        We =  ------

Sec. 25.729  Retracting mechanism.

(a) General. For airplanes with retractable landing gear, the following
apply:
(1) The landing gear retracting mechanism, wheel well doors, and supporting
structure, must be designed for--
(i) The loads occurring in the flight conditions when the gear is in the
retracted position,
(ii) The combination of friction loads, inertia loads, brake torque loads,
air loads, and gyroscopic loads resulting from the wheels rotating at a
peripheral speed equal to 1.3 Vs (with the flaps in takeoff position at
design takeoff weight), occurring during retraction and extension at any
airspeed up to 1.6 Vs1 (with the flaps in the approach position at design
landing weight), and
(iii) Any load factor up to those specified in Sec. 25.345(a) for the flaps
extended condition.
(2) Unless there are other means to decelerate the airplane in flight at
this speed, the landing gear, the retracting mechanism, and the airplane
structure (including wheel well doors) must be designed to withstand the
flight loads occurring with the landing gear in the extended position at any
speed up to 0.67 VC.
(3) Landing gear doors, their operating mechanism, and their supporting
structures must be designed for the yawing maneuvers prescribed for the
airplane in addition to the conditions of airspeed and load factor prescribed
in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.
(b) Landing gear lock. There must be positive means to keep the landing
gear extended, in flight and on the ground.
(c) Emergency operation. There must be an emergency means for extending the
landing gear in the event of--
(1) Any reasonably probable failure in the normal retraction system; or
(2) The failure of any single source of hydraulic, electric, or equivalent
energy supply.
(d) Operation test. The proper functioning of the retracting mechanism must
be shown by operation tests.
(e) Position indicator and warning device. If a retractable landing gear is
used, there must be a landing gear position indicator (as well as necessary
switches to actuate the indicator) or other means to inform the pilot that
the gear is secured in the extended (or retracted) position. This means must
be designed as follows:
(1) If switches are used, they must be located and coupled to the landing
gear mechanical systems in a manner that prevents an erroneous indication of
"down and locked" if the landing gear is not in a fully extended position, or
of "up and locked" if the landing gear is not in the fully retracted
position. The switches may be located where they are operated by the actual
landing gear locking latch or device.
(2) The flightcrew must be given an aural warning that functions
continuously, or is periodically repeated, if a landing is attempted when the
landing gear is not locked down.
(3) The warning must be given in sufficient time to allow the landing gear
to be locked down or a go-around to be made.
(4) There must not be a manual shut-off means readily available to the
flightcrew for the warning required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section such
that it could be operated instinctively, inadvertently, or by habitual
reflexive action.
(5) The system used to generate the aural warning must be designed to
eliminate false or inappropriate alerts.
(6) Failures of systems used to inhibit the landing gear aural warning,
that would prevent the warning system from operating, must be improbable.
(f) Protection of equipment in wheel wells. Equipment that is essential to
safe operation of the airplane and that is located in wheel wells must be
protected from the damaging effects of--
(1) A bursting tire, unless it is shown that a tire cannot burst from
overheat; and
(2) A loose tire tread, unless it is shown that a loose tire tread cannot
cause damage.

Sec. 25.733  Tires.

(a) When a landing gear axle is fitted with a single wheel and tire
assembly, the wheel must be fitted with a suitable tire of proper fit with a
speed rating approved by the Administrator that is not exceeded under
critical conditions and with a load rating approved by the Administrator that
is not exceeded under--
(1) The loads on the main wheel tire, corresponding to the most critical
combination of airplane weight (up to maximum weight) and center of gravity
position, and
(2) The loads corresponding to the ground reactions in paragraph (b) of
this section, on the nose wheel tire, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)
and (b)(3) of this section.
(b) The applicable ground reactions for nose wheel tires are as follows:
(1) The static ground reaction for the tire corresponding to the most
critical combination of airplane weight (up to maximum ramp weight) and
center of gravity position with a force of 1.0g acting downward at the center
of gravity. This load may not exceed the load rating of the tire.
(2) The ground reaction of the tire corresponding to the most critical
combination of airplane weight (up to maximum landing weight) and center of
gravity position combined with forces of 1.0g downward and 0.31g forward
acting at the center of gravity. The reactions in this case must be
distributed to the nose and main wheels by the principles of statics with a
drag reaction equal to 0.31 times the vertical load at each wheel with brakes
capable of producing this ground reaction. This nose tire load may not exceed
1.5 times the load rating of the tire.
(3) The ground reaction of the tire corresponding to the most critical
combination of airplane weight (up to maximum ramp weight) and center of
gravity position combined with forces of 1.0g downward and 0.20g forward
acting at the center of gravity. The reactions in this case must be
distributed to the nose and main wheels by the principles of statics with a
drag reaction equal to 0.20 times the vertical load at each wheel with brakes
capable of producing this ground reaction. This nose tire load may not exceed
1.5 times the load rating of the tire.
(c) When a landing gear axle is fitted with more than one wheel and tire
assembly, such as dual or dual-tandem, each wheel must be fitted with a
suitable tire of proper fit with a speed rating approved by the Administrator
that is not exceeded under critical conditions, and with a load rating
approved by the Administrator that is not exceeded by--
(1) The loads on each main wheel tire, corresponding to the most critical
combination of airplane weight (up to maximum weight) and center of gravity
position, when multiplied by a factor of 1.07; and
(2) Loads specified in paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of
this section on each nose wheel tire.
(d) Each tire installed on a retractable landing gear system must, at the
maximum size of the tire type expected in service, have a clearance to
surrounding structure and systems that is adequate to prevent unintended
contact between the tire and any part of the structure or systems.
(e) For an airplane with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of more than
75,000 pounds, tires mounted on braked wheels must be inflated with dry
nitrogen or other gases shown to be inert so that the gas mixture in the tire
does not contain oxygen in excess of 5 percent by volume, unless it can be
shown that the tire liner material will not produce a volatile gas when
heated or that means are provided to prevent tire temperatures from reaching
unsafe levels.

Sec. 25.735  Brakes.

(a) Each brake must be approved.
(b) The brake system and associated systems must be designed and
constructed so that if any electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical
connecting or transmitting element (excluding the operating pedal or handle)
fails, or if any single source of hydraulic or other brake operating energy
supply is lost, it is possible to bring the airplane to rest under conditions
specified in Sec. 25.125, with a mean deceleration during the landing roll of
at least 50 percent of that obtained in determining the landing distance as
prescribed in that section. Subcomponents within the brake assembly, such as
brake drum, shoes, and actuators (or their equivalents), shall be considered
as connecting or transmitting elements, unless it is shown that leakage of
hydraulic fluid resulting from failure of the sealing elements in these
subcomponents within the brake assembly would not reduce the braking
effectiveness below that specified in this paragraph.
(c) Brake controls may not require excessive control force in their
operation.
(d) The airplane must have a parking control that, when set by the pilot,
will without further attention, prevent the airplane from rolling on a paved,
level runway with takeoff power on the critical engine.
(e) If antiskid devices are installed, the devices and associated systems
must be designed so that no single probable malfunction will result in a
hazardous loss of braking ability or directional control of the airplane.
(f) The design landing brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main
wheel-brake assembly shall be used during qualification testing of the brake
to the applicable Technical Standard Order (TSO) or an acceptable equivalent.
This kinetic energy rating may not be less than the kinetic energy absorption
requirements determined under either of the following methods:
(1) The brake kinetic energy absorption requirements must be based on a
rational analysis of the sequence of events expected during operational
landings at maximum landing weight. This analysis must include conservative
values of airplane speed at which the brakes are applied, braking coefficient
of friction between tires and runway, aerodynamic drag, propeller drag or
power-plant forward thrust, and (if more critical) the most adverse single
engine or propeller malfunction.
(2) Instead of a rational analysis, the kinetic energy absorption
requirements for each main wheel-brake assembly may be derived from the
following formula, which must be modified in cases of designed unequal
braking distributions.

             [ ...Illustration appears here... ]

Where--
KE=Kinetic energy per wheel (ft.-lb.);
W=Design landing weight (lb.);
V=Airplane speed in knots. V must not be less than VS0, the power off
stalling speed of the airplane at sea level, at the design landing
weight, and in the landing configuration; and

N=Number of main wheels with brakes.
(g) The minimum stalling speed rating of each main wheel-brake assembly
(that is, the initial speed used in the dynamometer tests) may not be more
than the V used in the determination of kinetic energy in accordance with
paragraph (f) of this section, assuming that the test procedures for wheel-
brake assemblies involve a specified rate of deceleration, and, therefore,
for the same amount of kinetic energy, the rate of energy absorption (the
power absorbing ability of the brake) varies inversely with the initial
speed.
(h) The rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main
wheel-brake assembly that is at the fully worn limit of its allowable wear
range shall be used during qualification testing of the brake to the
applicable Technical Standard Order (TSO) or an acceptable equivalent. This
kinetic energy rating may not be less than the kinetic energy absorption
requirements determined under either of the following methods:
(1) The brake kinetic energy absorption requirements must be based on a
rational analysis of the sequence of events expected during an accelerate-
stop maneuver. This analysis must include conservative values of airplane
speed at which the brakes are applied, braking coefficient of friction
between tires and runway, aerodynamic drag, propeller drag or powerplant
forward thrust, and (if more critical) the most adverse single engine or
propeller malfunction.
(2) Instead of a rational analysis, the kinetic energy absorption
requirements for each main wheel brake assembly may be derived from the
following formula, which must be modified in cases of designed unequal
braking distributions:

             [ ...Illustration appears here... ]

Where--
KE=Kinetic energy per wheel (ft.-lb.);
W=Airplane weight (lb.);
V=Airplane speed (knots);
N=Number of main wheels with brakes; and
W and V are the most critical combination of takeoff weight and ground speed
obtained in a rejected takeoff.

(a) Nonprecipitation conditions. For nonprecipitation conditions, the
following apply:

(a) Internal panes must be made of nonsplintering material.
(b) Windshield panes directly in front of the pilots in the normal conduct
of their duties, and the supporting structures for these panes, must
withstand, without penetration, the impact of a four-pound bird when the
velocity of the airplane (relative to the bird along the airplane's flight
path) is equal to the value of VC, at sea level, selected under Sec.
25.335(a).
(c) Unless it can be shown by analysis or tests that the probability of
occurrence of a critical windshield fragmentation condition is of a low
order, the airplane must have a means to minimize the danger to the pilots
from flying windshield fragments due to bird impact. This must be shown for
each transparent pane in the cockpit that--
(1) Appears in the front view of the airplane;
(2) Is inclined 15 degrees or more to the longitudinal axis of the
airplane; and
(3) Has any part of the pane located where its fragmentation will
constitute a hazard to the pilots.
(d) The design of windshields and windows in pressurized airplanes must be
based on factors peculiar to high altitude operation, including the effects
of continuous and cyclic pressurization loadings, the inherent
characteristics of the material used, and the effects of temperatures and
temperature differentials. The windshield and window panels must be capable
of withstanding the maximum cabin pressure differential loads combined with
critical aerodynamic pressure and temperature effects after any single
failure in the installation or associated systems. It may be assumed that,
after a single failure that is obvious to the flight crew (established under
Sec. 25.1523), the cabin pressure differential is reduced from the maximum,
in accordance with appropriate operating limitations, to allow continued safe
flight of the airplane with a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 15,000
feet.
(e) The windshield panels in front of the pilots must be arranged so that,
assuming the loss of vision through any one panel, one or more panels remain
available for use by a pilot seated at a pilot station to permit continued
safe flight and landing.

Sec. 25.777  Cockpit controls.

(a) Each cockpit control must be located to provide convenient operation
and to prevent confusion and inadvertent operation.
(b) The direction of movement of cockpit controls must meet the
requirements of Sec. 25.779. Wherever practicable, the sense of motion
involved in the operation of other controls must correspond to the sense of
the effect of the operation upon the airplane or upon the part operated.
Controls of a variable nature using a rotary motion must move clockwise from
the off position, through an increasing range, to the full on position.
(c) The controls must be located and arranged, with respect to the pilots'
seats, so that there is full and unrestricted movement of each control
without interference from the cockpit structure or the clothing of the
minimum flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523) when any member of this
flight crew, from 5'2'' to 6'3'' in height, is seated with the seat belt and
shoulder harness (if provided) fastened.
(d) Identical powerplant controls for each engine must be located to
prevent confusion as to the engines they control.
(e) Wing flap controls and other auxiliary lift device controls must be
located on top of the pedestal, aft of the throttles, centrally or to the
right of the pedestal centerline, and not less than 10 inches aft of the
landing gear control.
(f) The landing gear control must be located forward of the throttles and
must be operable by each pilot when seated with seat belt and shoulder
harness (if provided) fastened.
(g) Control knobs must be shaped in accordance with Sec. 25.781. In
addition, the knobs must be of the same color, and this color must contrast
with the color of control knobs for other purposes and the surrounding
cockpit.
(h) If a flight engineer is required as part of the minimum flight crew
(established under Sec. 25.1523), the airplane must have a flight engineer
station located and arranged so that the flight crewmembers can perform their
functions efficiently and without interfering with each other.

Sec. 25.783  Doors.

(a) Each cabin must have at least one easily accessible external door.
(b) There must be a means to lock and safeguard each external door against
opening in flight (either inadvertently by persons or as a result of
mechanical failure or failure of a single structural element either during or
after closure). Each external door must be openable from both the inside and
the outside, even though persons may be crowded against the door on the
inside of the airplane. Inward opening doors may be used if there are means
to prevent occupants from crowding against the door to an extent that would
interfere with the opening of the door. The means of opening must be simple
and obvious and must be arranged and marked so that it can be readily located
and operated, even in darkness. Auxiliary locking devices may be used.
(c) Each external door must be reasonably free from jamming as a result of
fuselage deformation in a minor crash.
(d) Each external door must be located where persons using them will not be
endangered by the propellers when appropriate operating procedures are used.
(e) There must be a provision for direct visual inspection of the locking
mechanism to determine if external doors, for which the initial opening
movement is not inward (including passenger, crew, service, and cargo doors),
are fully closed and locked. The provision must be discernible under
operational lighting conditions by appropriate crewmembers using a flashlight
or equivalent lighting source. In addition, there must be a visual warning
means to signal the appropriate flight crewmembers if any external door is
not fully closed and locked. The means must be designed such that any failure
or combination of failures that would result in an erroneous closed and
locked indication is improbable for doors for which the initial opening
movement is not inward.
(f) External doors must have provisions to prevent the initiation of
pressurization of the airplane to an unsafe level if the door is not fully
closed and locked. In addition, it must be shown by safety analysis that
inadvertent opening is extemely improbable.
(g) Cargo and service doors not suitable for use as emergency exits need
only meet paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and be safeguarded against
opening in flight as a result of mechanical failure or failure of a single
structural element.
(i) If an integral stair is installed in a passenger entry door that is
qualified as a passenger emergency exit, the stair must be designed so that
under the following conditions the effectiveness of passenger emergency
egress will not be impaired:
(1) The door, integral stair, and operating mechanism have been subjected
to the inertia forces specified in Sec. 25.561(b)(3), acting separately
relative to the surrounding structure.
(2) The airplane is in the normal ground attitude and in each of the
attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear.
(j) All lavatory doors must be designed to preclude anyone from becoming
trapped inside the lavatory, and if a locking mechanism is installed, it be
capable of being unlocked from the outside without the aid of special tools.

Sec. 25.785  Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses.

(a) A seat (or berth for a nonambulant person) must be provided for each
occupant who has reached his or her second birthday.
(b) Each seat, berth, safety belt, harness, and adjacent part of the
airplane at each station designated as occupiable during takeoff and landing
must be designed so that a person making proper use of these facilities will
not suffer serious injury in an emergency landing as a result of the inertia
forces specified in Secs. 25.561 and 25.562.
(c) Each seat or berth must be approved.
(d) Each occupant of a seat that makes more than an 18-degree angle with
the vertical plane containing the airplane centerline must be protected from
head injury by a safety belt and an energy absorbing rest that will support
the arms, shoulders, head, and spine, or by a safety belt and shoulder
harness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious object. Each
occupant of any other seat must be protected from head injury by a safety
belt and, as appropriate to the type, location, and angle of facing of each
seat, by one or more of the following:
(1) A shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any
injurious object.
(2) The elimination of any injurious object within striking radius of the
head.
(3) An energy absorbing rest that will support the arms, shoulders, head,
and spine.
(e) Each berth must be designed so that the forward part has a padded end
board, canvas diaphragm, or equivalent means, that can withstand the static
load reaction of the occupant when subjected to the forward inertia force
specified in Sec. 25.561. Berths must be free from corners and protuberances
likely to cause injury to a person occupying the berth during emergency
conditions.
(f) Each seat or berth, and its supporting structure, and each safety belt
or harness and its anchorage must be designed for an occupant weight of 170
pounds, considering the maximum load factors, inertia forces, and reactions
among the occupant, seat, safety belt, and harness for each relevant flight
and ground load condition (including the emergency landing conditions
prescribed in Sec. 25.561). In addition--
(1) The structural analysis and testing of the seats, berths, and their
supporting structures may be determined by assuming that the critical load in
the forward, sideward, downward, upward, and rearward directions (as
determined from the prescribed flight, ground, and emergency landing
conditions) acts separately or using selected combinations of loads if the
required strength in each specified direction is substantiated. The forward
load factor need not be applied to safety belts for berths.
(2) Each pilot seat must be designed for the reactions resulting from the
application of the pilot forces prescribed in Sec. 25.395.
(3) The inertia forces specified in Sec. 25.561 must be multiplied by a
factor of 1.33 (instead of the fitting factor prescribed in Sec. 25.625) in
determining the strength of the attachment of each seat to the structure and
each belt or harness to the seat or structure.
(g) Each seat at a flight deck station must have a restraint system
consisting of a combined safety belt and shoulder harness with a single-point
release that permits the flight deck occupant, when seated with the restraint
system fastened, to perform all of the occupant's necessary flight deck
functions. There must be a means to secure each combined restraint system
when not in use to prevent interference with the operation of the airplane
and with rapid egress in an emergency.
(h) Each seat located in the passenger compartment and designated for use
during takeoff and landing by a flight attendant required by the operating
rules of this chapter must be:
(1) Near a required floor level emergency exit, except that another
location is acceptable if the emergency egress of passengers would be
enhanced with that location. A flight attendant seat must be located adjacent
to each Type A or B emergency exit. Other flight attendant seats must be
evenly distributed among the required floor-level emergency exits to the
extent feasible.
(2) To the extent possible, without compromising proximity to a required
floor level emergency exit, located to provide a direct view of the cabin
area for which the flight attendant is responsible.
(3) Positioned so that the seat will not interfere with the use of a
passageway or exit when the seat is not in use.
(4) Located to minimize the probability that occupants would suffer injury
by being struck by items dislodged from service areas, stowage compartments,
or service equipment.
(5) Either forward or rearward facing with an energy absorbing rest that is
designed to support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine.
(6) Equipped with a restraint system consisting of a combined safety belt
and shoulder harness unit with a single point release. There must be means to
secure each restraint system when not in use to prevent interference with
rapid egress in an emergency.
(i) Each safety belt must be equipped with a metal to metal latching
device.
(j) If the seat backs do not provide a firm handhold, there must be a
handgrip or rail along each aisle to enable persons to steady themselves
while using the aisles in moderately rough air.
(k) Each projecting object that would injure persons seated or moving about
the airplane in normal flight must be padded.
(l) Each forward observer's seat required by the operating rules must be
shown to be suitable for use in conducting the necessary enroute inspection.

Sec. 25.787  Stowage compartments.

(a) Each compartment for the stowage of cargo, baggage, carry-on articles,
and equipment (such as life rafts), and any other stowage compartment must be
designed for its placarded maximum weight of contents and for the critical
load distribution at the appropriate maximum load factors corresponding to
the specified flight and ground load conditions, and to the emergency landing
conditions of Sec. 25.561(b), except that the forces specified in the
emergency landing conditions need not be applied to compartments located
below, or forward, of all occupants in the airplane. If the airplane has a
passenger seating configuration, excluding pilots seats, of 10 seats or more,
each stowage compartment in the passenger cabin, except for underseat and
overhead compartments for passenger convenience, must be completely enclosed.
(b) There must be a means to prevent the contents in the compartments from
becoming a hazard by shifting, under the loads specified in paragraph (a) of
this section. For stowage compartments in the passenger and crew cabin, if
the means used is a latched door, the design must take into consideration the
wear and deterioration expected in service.
(c) If cargo compartment lamps are installed, each lamp must be installed
so as to prevent contact between lamp bulb and cargo.

Sec. 25.789  Retention of items of mass in passenger and crew compartments
and galleys.

(a) Means must be provided to prevent each item of mass (that is part of
the airplane type design) in a passenger or crew compartment or galley from
becoming a hazard by shifting under the appropriate maximum load factors
corresponding to the specified flight and ground load conditions, and to the
emergency landing conditions of Sec. 25.561(b).
(b) Each interphone restraint system must be designed so that when
subjected to the load factors specified in Sec. 25.561(b)(3), the interphone
will remain in its stowed position.

Sec. 25.791  Passenger information signs and placards.

(a) If smoking is to be prohibited, there must be at least one placard so
stating that is legible to each person seated in the cabin. If smoking is to
be allowed, and if the crew compartment is separated from the passenger
compartment, there must be at least one sign notifying when smoking is
prohibited. Signs which notify when smoking is prohibited must be operable by
a member of the flightcrew and, when illuminated, must be legible under all
probable conditions of cabin illumination to each person seated in the cabin.
(b) Signs that notify when seat belts should be fastened and that are
installed to comply with the operating rules of this chapter must be operable
by a member of the flightcrew and, when illuminated, must be legible under
all probable conditions of cabin illumination to each person seated in the
cabin.
(c) A placard must be located on or adjacent to the door of each receptacle
used for the disposal of flammable waste materials to indicate that use of
the receptacle for disposal of cigarettes, etc., is prohibited.
(d) Lavatories must have "No Smoking" or "No Smoking in Lavatory" placards
conspicuously located on or adjacent to each side of the entry door.
(e) Symbols that clearly express the intent of the sign or placard may be
used in lieu of letters.

                    Emergency Provisions






Sec. 25.801  Ditching.

(a) If certification with ditching provisions is requested, the airplane
must meet the requirements of this section and Secs. 25.807(e), 25.1411, and
25.1415(a).
(b) Each practicable design measure, compatible with the general
characteristics of the airplane, must be taken to minimize the probability
that in an emergency landing on water, the behavior of the airplane would
cause immediate injury to the occupants or would make it impossible for them
to escape.
(c) The probable behavior of the airplane in a water landing must be
investigated by model tests or by comparison with airplanes of similar
configuration for which the ditching characteristics are known. Scoops,
flaps, projections, and any other factor likely to affect the hydrodynamic
characteristics of the airplane, must be considered.
(d) It must be shown that, under reasonably probable water conditions, the
flotation time and trim of the airplane will allow the occupants to leave the
airplane and enter the liferafts required by Sec. 25.1415. If compliance with
this provision is shown by buoyancy and trim computations, appropriate
allowances must be made for probable structural damage and leakage. If the
airplane has fuel tanks (with fuel jettisoning provisions) that can
reasonably be expected to withstand a ditching without leakage, the
jettisonable volume of fuel may be considered as buoyancy volume.
(e) Unless the effects of the collapse of external doors and windows are
accounted for in the investigation of the probable behavior of the airplane
in a water landing (as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section),
the external doors and windows must be designed to withstand the probable
maximum local pressures.

Sec. 25.803  Emergency evacuation.

(a) Each crew and passenger area must have emergency means to allow rapid
evacuation in crash landings, with the landing gear extended as well as with
the landing gear retracted, considering the possibility of the airplane being
on fire.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) For airplanes having a seating capacity of more than 44 passengers, it
must be shown that the maximum seating capacity, including the number of
crewmembers required by the operating rules for which certification is
requested, can be evacuated from the airplane to the ground under simulated
emergency conditions within 90 seconds. Compliance with this requirement must
be shown by actual demonstration using the test criteria outlined in appendix
J of this part unless the Administrator finds that a combination of analysis
and testing will provide data equivalent to that which would be obtained by
actual demonstration.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) [Reserved]

Sec. 25.805  [Removed.  55 FR 29781, July 20, 1990]

Sec. 25.807   Emergency exits.

(a) Type. For the purpose of this part, the types of exits are defined as
follows:
(1) Type I. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of
not less than 24 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner radii not greater
than eight inches.
(2) Type II. This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 20 inches
wide by 44 inches high, with corner radii not greater than seven inches. Type
II exits must be floor-level exits unless located over the wing, in which
case they must not have a step-up inside the airplane of more than 10 inches
nor a step-down outside the airplane of more than 17 inches.
(3) Type III. This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 20 inches
wide by 36 inches high with corner radii not greater than seven inches, and
with a step-up inside the airplane of not more than 20 inches. If the exit is
located over the wing, the step-down outside the airplane may not exceed 27
inches.
(4) Type IV. This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 19 inches
wide by 26 inches high, with corner radii not greater than 6.3 inches,
located over the wing, with a step-up inside the airplane of not more than 29
inches and a step-down outside the airplane of not more than 36 inches.
(5) Ventral. This type is an exit from the passenger compartment through
the pressure shell and the bottom fuselage skin. The dimensions and physical
configuration of this type of exit must allow at least the same rate of
egress as a Type I exit with the airplane in the normal ground attitude, with
landing gear extended.
(6) Tail cone. This type is an aft exit from the passenger compartment
through the pressure shell and through an openable cone of the fuselage aft
of the pressure shell. The means of opening the tailcone must be simple and
obvious and must employ a single operation.
(7) Type A. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of
not less than 42 inches wide by 72 inches high, with corner radii not greater
than seven inches.
(8) Type B. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of
not less than 32 inches wide by 72 inches high, with corner radii not greater
than six inches.
(9) Type C. This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of
not less than 30 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner radii not greater
than 10 inches.
(b) Step down distance. Step down distance, as used in this section, means
the actual distance between the bottom of the required opening and a usable
foot hold, extending out from the fuselage, that is large enough to be
effective without searching by sight or feel.
(c) Over-sized exits. Openings larger than those specified in this section,
whether or not of rectangular shape, may be used if the specified rectangular
opening can be inscribed within the opening and the base of the inscribed
rectangular opening meets the specified step-up and step-down heights.
(d) Asymmetry. Exits of an exit pair need not be diametrically opposite
each other nor of the same size; however, the number of passenger seats
permitted under paragraph (g) of this section is based on the smaller of the
two exits.
(e) Uniformity. Exits must be distributed as uniformly as practical, taking
into account passenger seat distribution.
(f) Location. (1) Each required passenger emergency exit must be accessible
to the passengers and located where it will afford the most effective means
of passenger evacuation.
(2) If only one floor-level exit per side is prescribed, and the airplane
does not have a tail-cone or ventral emergency exit, the floor-level exits
must be in the rearward part of the passenger compartment unless another
location affords a more effective means of passenger evacuation.
(3) If more than one floor-level exit per side is prescribed, and the
airplane does not have a combination cargo and passenger configuration, at
least one floor-level exit must be located in each side near each end of the
cabin.
(4) For an airplane that is required to have more than one passenger
emergency exit for each side of the fuselage, no passenger emergency exit
shall be more than 60 feet from any adjacent passenger emergency exit on the
same side of the same deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the
airplane's longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges.
(g) Type and number required. The maximum number of passenger seats
permitted depends on the type and number of exits installed in each side of
the fuselage. Except as further restricted in paragraphs (g)(1) through
(g)(9) of this section, the maximum number of passenger seats permitted for
each exit of a specific type installed in each side of the fuselage is as
follows:

                             Type A    110
                             Type B     75
                             Type C     55
                             Type I     45

                             Type III   35
                             Type IV     9

(1) For a passenger seating configuration of 1 to 9 seats, there must be at
least one Type IV or larger overwing exit in each side of the fuselage or, if
overwing exits are not provided, at least one exit in each side that meets
the minimum dimensions of a Type III exit.
(2) For a passenger seating configuration of more than 9 seats, each exit
must be a Type III or larger exit.
(3) For a passenger seating configuration of 10 to 19 seats, there must be
at least one Type III or larger exit in each side of the fuselage.
(4) For a passenger seating configuration of 20 to 40 seats, there must be
at least two exits, one of which must be a Type II or larger exit, in each
side of the fuselage.
(5) For a passenger seating configuration of 41 to 110 seats, there must be
at least two exits, one of which must be a Type I or larger exit, in each
side of the fuselage.
(6) For a passenger seating configuration of more than 110 seats, the
emergency exits in each side of the fuselage must include at least two Type I
or larger exits.
(7) The combined maximum number of passenger seats permitted for all Type
III exits is 70, and the combined maximum number of passenger seats permitted
for two Type III exits in each side of the fuselage that are separated by
fewer than three passenger seat rows in 65.
(8) If a Type A, Type B, or Type C exit is installed, there must be at
least two Type C or larger exits in each side of the fuselage.
(9) If a passenger ventral or tail cone exit is installed and that exit
provides at least the same rate of egress as a Type III exit with the
airplane in the most adverse exit opening condition that would result from
the collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear, an increase in the
passenger seating configuration is permitted as follows:
(i) For a ventral exit, 12 additional passenger seats.
(ii) For a tail cone exit incorporating a floor level opening of not less
than 20 inches wide by 60 inches high, with corner radii not greater than
seven inches, in the pressure shell and incorporating an approved assist
means in accordance with Sec. 25.810(a), 25 additional passenger seats.
(iii) For a tail cone exit incorporating an opening in the pressure shell
which is at least equivalent to a Type III emergency exit with respect to
dimensions, step-up and step-down distance, and with the top of the opening

passenger seats.
(h) Excess exits. Each emergency exit in the passenger compartment in
excess of the minimum number of required emergency exits must meet the
applicable requirements of Sec. 25.809 through Sec. 25.812, and must be
readily accessible.
(i) Ditching emergency exits for passengers. Whether or not ditching
certification is requested, ditching emergency exits must be provided in
accordance with the following requirements, unless the emergency exits
required by paragraph (g) of this section already meet them:
(1) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of nine or
fewer seats, excluding pilot seats, one exit above the waterline in each side
of the airplane, meeting at least the dimensions of a Type IV exit.
(2) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 10 of more

airplane, meeting at least the dimensions of a Type III exit for each unit
(or part of a unit) of 35 passenger seats, but no less than two such exits in
the passenger cabin, with one on each side of the airplane. The passenger
seat/ exit ratio may be increased through the use of larger exits, or other
means, provided it is shown that the evacuation capability during ditching
has been improved accordingly.
(3) If it is impractical to locate side exits above the waterline, the side
exits must be replaced by an equal number of readily accessible overhead
hatches of not less than the dimensions of a Type III exit, except that for
airplanes with a passenger configuration of 35 or fewer seats, excluding
pilot seats, the two required Type III side exits need be replaced by only

airplanes having a passenger seating capacity greater than 20, flightcrew
exits shall be located in the flightcrew area. Such exits shall be of
sufficient size and so located as to permit rapid evacuation by the crew. One
exit shall be provided on each side of the airplane; or, alternatively, a top
hatch shall be provided. Each exit must encompass an unobstructed rectangular
opening of at least 19 by 20 inches unless satisfactory exit utility can be
demonstrated by a typical crewmember.

Sec. 25.809  Emergency exit arrangement.

(a) Each emergency exit, including a flight crew emergency exit, must be a
movable door or hatch in the external walls of the fuselage, allowing
unobstructed opening to the outside.
(b) Each emergency exit must be openable from the inside and the outside
except that sliding window emergency exits in the flight crew area need not
be openable from the outside if other approved exits are convenient and
readily accessible to the flight crew area. Each emergency exit must be
capable of being opened, when there is no fuselage deformation--
(1) With the airplane in the normal ground attitude and in each of the
attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear;
and
(2) Within 10 seconds measured from the time when the opening means is
actuated to the time when the exit is fully opened.
(c) The means of opening emergency exits must be simple and obvious and may
not require exceptional effort. Internal exit-opening means involving
sequence operations (such as operation of two handles or latches or the
release of safety catches) may be used for flight crew emergency exits if it
can be reasonably established that these means are simple and obvious to
crewmembers trained in their use.
(d) If a single power-boost or single power-operated system is the primary
system for operating more than one exit in an emergency, each exit must be
capable of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section in the
event of failure of the primary system. Manual operation of the exit (after
failure of the primary system) is acceptable.
(e) Each emergency exit must be shown by tests, or by a combination of
analysis and tests, to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of
this section.
(f) There must be a means to lock each emergency exit and to safeguard
against its opening in flight, either inadvertently by persons or as a result
of mechanical failure. In addition, there must be a means for direct visual
inspection of the locking mechanism by crewmembers to determine that each
emergency exit, for which the initial opening movement is outward, is fully
locked.
(g) There must be provisions to minimize the probability of jamming of the
emergency exits resulting from fuselage deformation in a minor crash landing.
(h) When required by the operating rules for any large passenger-carrying
turbojet-powered airplane, each ventral exit and tailcone exit must be--
(1) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight; and
(2) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and
installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit,
stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it cannot be
opened during flight.

Sec. 25.810  Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.

(a) Each non over-wing Type A, Type B or Type C exit, and any other non
over-wing landplane emergency exit more than 6 feet from the ground with the
airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, must have an approved
means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground.
(1) The assisting means for each passenger emergency exit must be a self-
supporting slide or equivalent; and, in the case of Type A or Type B exits,
it must be capable of carrying simultaneously two parallel lines of evacuees.
In addition, the assisting means must be designed to meet the following
requirements--
(i) It must be automatically deployed and deployment must begin during the
interval between the time the exit opening means is actuated from inside the
airplane and the time the exit is fully opened. However, each passenger
emergency exit which is also a passenger entrance door or a service door must
be provided with means to prevent deployment of the assisting means when it
is opened from either the inside or the outside under nonemergency conditions
for normal use.
(ii) Except for assisting means installed at Type C exits, it must be
automatically erected within 6 seconds after deployment is begun. Assisting
means installed at Type C exits must be automatically erected within 10
seconds from the time the opening means of the exit is actuated.
(iii) It must be of such length after full deployment that the lower end is
self-supporting on the ground and provides safe evacuation of occupants to
the ground after collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear.
(iv) It must have the capability, in 25-knot winds directed from the most
critical angle, to deploy and, with the assistance of only one person, to
remain usable after full deployment to evacuate occupants safely to the
ground.
(v) For each system installation (mockup or airplane installed), five
consecutive deployment and inflation tests must be conducted (per exit)
without failure, and at least three tests of each such five-test series must
be conducted using a single representative sample of the device. The sample
devices must be deployed and inflated by the system's primary means after
being subjected to the inertia forces specified in Sec. 25.561(b). If any
part of the system fails or does not function properly during the required
tests, the cause of the failure or malfunction must be corrected by positive
means and after that, the full series of five consecutive deployment and
inflation tests must be conducted without failure.
(2) The assisting means for flightcrew emergency exits may be a rope or any
other means demonstrated to be suitable for the purpose. If the assisting
means is a rope, or an approved device equivalent to a rope, it must be--
(i) Attached to the fuselage structure at or above the top of the emergency
exit opening, or, for a device at a pilot's emergency exit window, at another
approved location if the stowed device, or its attachment, would reduce the
pilot's view in flight;
(ii) Able (with its attachment) to withstand a 400-pound static load.
(b) Assist means from the cabin to the wing are required for each type A or
Type B exit located above the wing and having a stepdown unless the exit
without an assist-means can be shown to have a rate of passenger egress at
least equal to that of the same type of non over-wing exit. If an assist
means is required, it must be automatically deployed and automatically
erected concurrent with the opening of the exit. In the case of assist means
installed at Type C exits, it must be self-supporting within 10 seconds from
the time the opening means of the exits is actuated. For all other exit
types, it must be self-supporting 6 seconds after deployment is begun.
(c) An escape route must be established from each overwing emergency exit,
and (except for flap surfaces suitable as slides) covered with a slip
resistant surface. Except where a means for channeling the flow of evacuees
is provided--
(1) The escape route from each Type A or Type B passenger emergency exit,
or any common escape route from two Type III passenger emergency exits, must
be at least 42 inches wide; that from any other passenger emergency exit must
be at least 24 inches wide; and
(2) The escape route surface must have a reflectance of at least 80
percent, and must be defined by markings with a surface-to-marking contrast
ratio of at least 5:1.
(d) Means must be provided to assist evacuees to reach the ground for all
Type C exits located over the wing and, if the place on the airplane
structure at which the escape route required in paragraph (c) of this section
terminates is more than 6 feet from the ground with the airplane on the
ground and the landing gear extended, for all other exit types.
(1) If the escape route is over the flap, the height of the terminal edge
must be measured with the flap in the takeoff or landing position, whichever
is higher from the ground.
(2) The assisting means must be usable and self-supporting with one or more
landing gear legs collapsed and under a 25-knot wind directed from the most
critical angle.
(3) The assisting means provided for each escape route leading from a Type
A or B emergency exit must be capable of carrying simultaneously two parallel
lines of evacuees; and, the assisting means leading from any other exit type
must be capable of carrying as many parallel lines of evacuees as there are
required escape routes.
(4) The assisting means provided for each escape route leading from a Type
C exit must be automatically erected within 10 seconds from the time the
opening means of the exit is actuated, and that provided for the escape route
leading from any other exit type must be automatically erected within 10
seconds after actuation of the erection system.

Sec. 25.811  Emergency exit marking.

(a) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of
opening must be conspicuously marked.
(b) The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must be
recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin.
(c) Means must be provided to assist the occupants in locating the exits in
conditions of dense smoke.
(d) The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a
sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle (or
aisles). There must be--
(1) A passenger emergency exit locator sign above the aisle (or aisles)
near each passenger emergency exit, or at another overhead location if it is
more practical because of low headroom, except that one sign may serve more
than one exit if each exit can be seen readily from the sign;
(2) A passenger emergency exit marking sign next to each passenger
emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they both
can be seen readily from the sign; and
(3) A sign on each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision
along the passenger cabin to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by
the bulkhead or divider, except that if this is not possible the sign may be
placed at another appropriate location.
(e) The location of the operating handle and instructions for opening exits
from the inside of the airplane must be shown in the following manner:
Each Type III passenger emergency exit operating handle must be self-
illuminated with an initial brightness of at least 160 microlamberts. If the
operating handle is covered, self-illuminated cover removal instructions
having an initial brightness of at least 160 microlamberts must also be
provided.
(1) Each passenger emergency exit must have, on or near the exit, a marking
that is readable from a distance of 30 inches.
(2) Each Type A, Type B, Type C or Type I passenger emergency exit
operating handle must--
(i) Be self-illuminated with an initial brightness of at least 160
microlamberts; or
(ii) Be conspicuously located and well illuminated by the emergency
lighting even in conditions of occupant crowding at the exit.
(3) [Reserved]
(4) Each Type A, Type B, Type C, Type I, or Type II passenger emergency
exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle must be
marked--
(i) With a red arrow, with a shaft at least three-fourths of an inch wide
and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70 degrees
of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length.
(ii) So that the centerline of the exit handle is within +/-1 inch of the
projected point of the arrow when the handle has reached full travel and has
released the locking mechanism, and
(iii) With the word "open" in red letters 1 inch high, placed horizontally
near the head of the arrow.
(f) Each emergency exit that is required to be openable from the outside,
and its means of opening, must be marked on the outside of the airplane. In
addition, the following apply:
(1) The outside marking for each passenger emergency exit in the side of
the fuselage must include a 2-inch colored band outlining the exit.
(2) Each outside marking including the band, must have color contrast to be
readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage surface. The contrast
must be such that if the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or
less, the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent.
"Reflectance" is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the
luminous flux it receives. When the reflectance of the darker color is
greater than 15 percent, at least a 30-percent difference between its
reflectance and the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.
(3) In the case of exists other than those in the side of the fuselage,
such as ventral or tail cone exists, the external means of opening, including
instructions if applicable, must be conspicuously marked in red, or bright
chrome yellow if the background color is such that red is inconspicuous. When
the opening means is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous
marking to that effect must be provided on the other side.
(g) Each sign required by paragraph (d) of this section may use the word
"exit" in its legend in place of the term "emergency exit".

emergency exit, between the main aisles and the exit openings, must be
provided with illumination that is not less than 0.02 foot-candle measured
along a line that is within 6 inches of and parallel to the floor and is
centered on the passenger evacuation path.
(e) Floor proximity emergency escape path marking must provide emergency
evacuation guidance for passengers when all sources of illumination more than
4 feet above the cabin aisle floor are totally obscured. In the dark of the
night, the floor proximity emergency escape path marking must enable each
passenger to--
(1) After leaving the passenger seat, visually identify the emergency
escape path along the cabin aisle floor to the first exits or pair of exits
forward and aft of the seat; and
(2) Readily identify each exit from the emergency escape path by reference
only to markings and visual features not more than 4 feet above the cabin
floor.
(f) Except for subsystems provided in accordance with paragraph (h) of this

(ii) Not less than 0.05 foot-candle (measured normal to the direction of
incident light) along the 30 percent of the slip-resistant portion of the
escape route required in Sec. 25.810(c) that is farthest from the exit for
the minimum required width of the escape route; and
(iii) Not less than 0.03 foot-candle on the ground surface with the landing
gear extended (measured normal to the direction of the incident light) where
an evacuee using the established escape route would normally make first
contact with the ground.
(2) At each non-overwing emergency exit not required by Sec. 25.809(f) to
have descent assist means the illumination must be not less than 0.03 foot-
candle (measured normal to the direction of the incident light) on the ground
surface with the landing gear extended where an evacuee is likely to make his
first contact with the ground outside the cabin.
(h) The means required in Sec. 25.809 (f)(1) and (h) to assist the
occupants in descending to the ground must be illuminated so that the erected
assist means is visible from the airplane.
(1) If the assist means is illuminated by exterior emergency lighting, it
must provide illumination of not less than 0.03 foot-candle (measured normal
to the direction of the incident light) at the ground end of the erected
assist means where an evacuee using the established escape route would
normally make first contact with the ground, with the airplane in each of the
attitudes corresponding to the collapse of one or more legs of the landing
gear.
(2) If the emergency lighting subsystem illuminating the assist means
serves no other assist means, is independent of the airplane's main emergency
lighting system, and is automatically activated when the assist means is
erected, the lighting provisions--
(i) May not be adversely affected by stowage; and
(ii) Must provide illumination of not less than 0.03 foot-candle (measured
normal to the direction of incident light) at the ground and of the erected
assist means where an evacuee would normally make first contact with the
ground, with the airplane in each of the attitudes corresponding to the
collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear.
(i) The energy supply to each emergency lighting unit must provide the
required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the critical
ambient conditions after emergency landing.
(j) If storage batteries are used as the energy supply for the emergency
lighting system, they may be recharged from the airplane's main electric
power system: Provided, That, the charging circuit is designed to preclude
inadvertent battery discharge into charging circuit faults.
(k) Components of the emergency lighting system, including batteries,
wiring relays, lamps, and switches must be capable of normal operation after
having been subjected to the inertia forces listed in Sec. 25.561(b).
(l) The emergency lighting system must be designed so that after any single
transverse vertical separation of the fuselage during crash landing--
(1) Not more than 25 percent of all electrically illuminated emergency
lights required by this section are rendered inoperative, in addition to the
lights that are directly damaged by the separation;
(2) Each electrically illuminated exit sign required under Sec.
25.811(d)(2) remains operative exclusive of those that are directly damaged
by the separation; and
(3) At least one required exterior emergency light for each side of the
airplane remains operative exclusive of those that are directly damaged by
the separation.

Sec. 25.813  Emergency exit access.

Each required emergency exit must be accessible to the passengers and
located where it will afford an effective means of evacuation. Emergency exit
distribution must be as uniform as practical, taking passenger distribution
into account; however, the size and location of exits on both sides of the
cabin need not be symmetrical. If only one floor level exit per side is
prescribed, and the airplane does not have a tail cone or ventral emergency
exit, the floor level exit must be in the rearward part of the passenger
compartment, unless another location affords a more effective means of
passenger evacuation. Where more than one floor level exit per side is
prescribed, at least one floor level exit per side must be located near each
end of the cabin, except that this provision does not apply to combination
cargo/passenger configurations. In addition--
(a) There must be a passageway leading from the nearest main aisle to each
Type A, Type B, Type C, Type I, or Type II emergency exit and between
individual passenger areas. Each passageway leading to a Type A or Type B
exit must be unobstructed and at least 36 inches wide. Passageways between
individual passenger areas and those leading to Type I, Type II, or Type C
emergency exits must be unobstructed and at least 20 inches wide. Unless
there are two or more main aisles, each Type A or B exit must be located so
that there is passenger flow along the main aisle to that exit from both the
forward and aft directions. If two or more main aisles are provided, there
must be unobstructed cross-aisles at least 20 inches wide between main
aisles. There must be--
(1) A cross-aisle which leads directly to each passageway between the
nearest main aisle and a Type A or B exit; and
(2) A cross-aisle which leads to the immediate vicinity of each passageway
between the nearest main aisle and a Type 1, Type II, or Type III exit;
except that when two Type III exits are located within three passenger rows
of each other, a single cross-aisle may be used if it leads to the vicinity
between the passageways from the nearest main aisle to each exit.
(b) Adequate space to allow crewmember(s) to assist in the evacuation of
passengers must be provided as follows:
(1) The assist space must not reduce the unobstructed width of the
passageway below that required for the exit.
(2) For each Type A or Type B exit, assist space must be provided at each
side of the exit regardless of whether a means is required by Sec. 25.810(a)
to assist passengers in descending to the ground from that exit.
(3) Assist space must be provided at one side of any other type exit
required by Sec. 25.810(a) to have a means to assist passengers in descending
to the ground from that exit.
(c) The following must be provided for each Type III or Type IV exit--(1)
There must be access from the nearest aisle to each exit. In addition, for
each Type III exit in an airplane that has a passenger seating configuration
of 60 or more--
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii), the access must be provided
by an unobstructed passageway that is at least 10 inches in width for
interior arrangements in which the adjacent seat rows on the exit side of the
aisle contain no more than two seats, or 20 inches in width for interior

seat installed on the airplane.
(ii) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 19 or
fewer, there may be minor obstructions in this region, if there are
compensating factors to maintain the effectiveness of the exit.
(3) For each Type III exit, regardless of the passenger capacity of the
airplane in which it is installed, there must be placards that--
(i) Are readable by all persons seated adjacent to and facing a passageway
to the exit;
(ii) Accurately state or illustrate the proper method of opening the exit,
including the use of handholds; and
(iii) If the exit is a removable hatch, state the weight of the hatch and
indicate an appropriate location to place the hatch after removal.
(d) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between passenger
compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any seat in the
passenger cabin, the passageway must be unobstructed. However, curtains may
be used if they allow free entry through the passageway.
(e) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger
compartments.
(f) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the passenger
cabin from other areas to reach any required emergency exit from any
passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in open position. The
latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the
door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding
structure, listed in Sec. 25.561(b).

Sec. 25.831   Ventilation.

(a) Under normal operating conditions and in the event of any probable
failure conditions of any system which would adversely affect the ventilating
air, the ventilation system must be designed to provide a sufficient amount
of uncontaminated air to enable the crewmembers to perform their duties
without undue discomfort or fatigue and to provide reasonable passenger
comfort. For normal operating conditions, the ventilation system must be
designed to provide each occupant with an airflow containing at least 0.55
pounds of fresh air per minute.
(b) Crew and passenger compartment air must be free from harmful or
hazardous concentrations of gases or vapors. In meeting this requirement, the

in paragraph (b) of this section are met after reasonably probable failures
or malfunctioning of the ventilating, heating, pressurization, or other
systems and equipment.
(d) If accumulation of hazardous quantities of smoke in the cockpit area is
reasonably probable, smoke evacuation must be readily accomplished, starting
with full pressurization and without depressurizing beyond safe limits.
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, means must be
provided to enable the occupants of the following compartments and areas to
control the temperature and quantity of ventilating air supplied to their
compartment or area independently of the temperature and quantity of air
supplied to other compartments and areas:
(1) The flight crew compartment.
(2) Crewmember compartments and areas other than the flight crew
compartment unless the crewmember compartment or area is ventilated by air
interchange with other compartments or areas under all operating conditions.
(f) Means to enable the flight crew to control the temperature and quantity
of ventilating air supplied to the flight crew compartment independently of

                       Pressurization






Sec. 25.841   Pressurized cabins.

(a) Pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be equipped to
provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8,000 feet at the maximum
operating altitude of the airplane under normal operating conditions.
(1) If certification for operation above 25,000 feet is requested, the
airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin
pressure altitudes in excess of 15,000 feet after any probable failure
condition in the pressurization system.
(2) The airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to
a cabin pressure altitude that exceeds the following after decompression from
any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable:
(i) Twenty-five thousand (25,000) feet for more than 2 minutes; or
(ii) Forty thousand (40,000) feet for any duration.
(3) Fuselage structure, engine and system failures are to be considered in
evaluating the cabin decompression.
(b) Pressurized cabins must have at least the following valves, controls,
and indicators for controlling cabin pressure:
(1) Two pressure relief valves to automatically limit the positive pressure
differential to a predetermined value at the maximum rate of flow delivered
by the pressure source. The combined capacity of the relief valves must be
large enough so that the failure of any one valve would not cause an
appreciable rise in the pressure differential. The pressure differential is
positive when the internal pressure is greater than the external.
(2) Two reverse pressure differential relief valves (or their equivalents)
to automatically prevent a negative pressure differential that would damage
the structure. One valve is enough, however, if it is of a design that
reasonably precludes its malfunctioning.
(3) A means by which the pressure differential can be rapidly equalized.
(4) An automatic or manual regulator for controlling the intake or exhaust
airflow, or both, for maintaining the required internal pressures and airflow
rates.
(5) Instruments at the pilot or flight engineer station to show the
pressure differential, the cabin pressure altitude, and the rate of change of
the cabin pressure altitude.
(6) Warning indication at the pilot or flight engineer station to indicate
when the safe or preset pressure differential and cabin pressure altitude
limits are exceeded. Appropriate warning markings on the cabin pressure
differential indicator meet the warning requirement for pressure differential
limits and an aural or visual signal (in addition to cabin altitude
indicating means) meets the warning requirement for cabin pressure altitude
limits if it warns the flight crew when the cabin pressure altitude exceeds
10,000 feet.
(7) A warning placard at the pilot or flight engineer station if the
structure is not designed for pressure differentials up to the maximum relief
valve setting in combination with landing loads.
(8) The pressure sensors necessary to meet the requirements of paragraphs
(b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section and Sec. 25.1447(c), must be located and
the sensing system designed so that, in the event of loss of cabin pressure
in any passenger or crew compartment (including upper and lower lobe
galleys), the warning and automatic presentation devices, required by those
provisions, will be actuated without any delay that would significantly
increase the hazards resulting from decompression.

Sec. 25.843  Tests for pressurized cabins.

(a) Strength test. The complete pressurized cabin, including doors,
windows, and valves, must be tested as a pressure vessel for the pressure
differential specified in Sec. 25.365(d).
(b) Functional tests. The following functional tests must be performed:
(1) Tests of the functioning and capacity of the positive and negative
pressure differential valves, and of the emergency release valve, to
stimulate the effects of closed regulator valves.
(2) Tests of the pressurization system to show proper functioning under
each possible condition of pressure, temperature, and moisture, up to the
maximum altitude for which certification is requested.
(3) Flight tests, to show the performance of the pressure supply, pressure
and flow regulators, indicators, and warning signals, in steady and stepped
climbs and descents at rates corresponding to the maximum attainable within
the operating limitations of the airplane, up to the maximum altitude for
which certification is requested.
(4) Tests of each door and emergency exit, to show that they operate
properly after being subjected to the flight tests prescribed in paragraph
(b)(3) of this section.

tests, a temperature is "stabilized" when its rate of change is less than two
degrees F. per minute.
(b) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which entry
is made into each stage of flight being investigated, unless the entry
condition normally is not one during which component and the engine fluid
temperatures would stabilize (in which case, operation through the full entry
condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight being
investigated in order to allow temperatures to reach their natural levels at
the time of entry). The takeoff cooling test must be preceded by a period
during which the powerplant component and engine fluid temperatures are
stabilized with the engines at ground idle.
(c) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until--
(1) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;
(2) The stage of flight is completed; or
(3) An operating limitation is reached.
(d) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it may be assumed, for
cooling test purposes, that the takeoff stage of flight is complete when the
airplane reaches an altitude of 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface or
reaches a point in the takeoff where the transition from the takeoff to the
en route configuration is completed and a speed is reached at which
compliance with Sec. 25.121(c) is shown, whichever point is at a higher
altitude. The airplane must be in the following configuration:
(1) Landing gear retracted.
(2) Wing flaps in the most favorable position.
(3) Cowl flaps (or other means of controlling the engine cooling supply) in
the position that provides adequate cooling in the hot-day condition.

(e) If the engine induction system contains parts or components that could
be damaged by foreign objects entering the air inlet, it must be shown by
tests or, if appropriate, by analysis that the induction system design can
withstand the foreign object ingestion test conditions of Sec. 33.77 of this
chapter without failure of parts or components that could create a hazard.

Sec. 25.1325  Static pressure systems.

(a) Each instrument with static air case connections must be vented to the
outside atmosphere through an appropriate piping system.
(b) Each static port must be designed and located in such manner that the

intermittent maximum icing conditions defined in Appendix C of this part.
(c) The design and installation of the static pressure system must be such
that--
(1) Positive drainage of moisture is provided; chafing of the tubing and
excessive distortion or restriction at bends in the tubing is avoided; and
the materials used are durable, suitable for the purpose intended, and
protected against corrosion; and
(2) It is airtight except for the port into the atmosphere. A proof test
must be conducted to demonstrate the integrity of the static pressure system
in the following manner:
(i) Unpressurized airplanes. Evacuate the static pressure system to a
pressure differential of approximately 1 inch of mercury or to a reading on
the altimeter, 1,000 feet above the airplane elevation at the time of the
test. Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, the loss of
indicated altitude must not exceed 100 feet on the altimeter.

pressure differential equivalent to the maximum cabin pressure differential
for which the airplane is type certificated is achieved. Without additional
pumping for a period of 1 minute, the loss of indicated altitude must not
exceed 2 percent of the equivalent altitude of the maximum cabin differential
pressure or 100 feet, whichever is greater.
(d) Each pressure altimeter must be approved and must be calibrated to

practicable calibration error when the corresponding static pressures are
applied.
(e) Each system must be designed and installed so that the error in
indicated pressure altitude, at sea level, with a standard atmosphere,
excluding instrument calibration error, does not result in an error of more
than +/-30 feet per 100 knots speed for the appropriate configuration in the
speed range between 1.3 VS0 with flaps extended and 1.8 VS1 with flaps
retracted. However, the error need not be less than +/-30 feet.
(f) If an altimeter system is fitted with a device that provides
corrections to the altimeter indication, the device must be designed and
installed in such manner that it can be bypassed when it malfunctions, unless
an alternate altimeter system is provided. Each correction device must be
fitted with a means for indicating the occurrence of reasonably probable
malfunctions, including power failure, to the flight crew. The indicating
means must be effective for any cockpit lighting condition likely to occur.
(g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, if the static
pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate static pressure
source, the means for selecting one or the other source must be designed so
that--
(1) When either source is selected, the other is blocked off; and
(2) Both sources cannot be blocked off simultaneously.
(h) For unpressurized airplanes, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not
apply if it can be demonstrated that the static pressure system calibration,
when either static pressure source is selected, is not changed by the other
static pressure source being open or blocked.

(a) General. The intensities prescribed in this section must be provided by
new equipment with light covers and color filters in place. Intensities must
be determined with the light source operating at a steady value equal to the
average luminous output of the source at the normal operating voltage of the
airplane. The light distribution and intensity of each position light must
meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) Forward and rear position lights. The light distribution and
intensities of forward and rear position lights must be expressed in terms of
minimum intensities in the horizontal plane, minimum intensities in any
vertical plane, and maximum intensities in overlapping beams, within dihedral
angles L, R, and A, and must meet the following requirements:
(1) Intensities in the horizontal plane. Each intensity in the horizontal
plane (the plane containing the longitudinal axis of the airplane and
perpendicular to the plane of symmetry of the airplane) must equal or exceed
the values in Sec. 25.1391.
(2) Intensities in any vertical plane.  Each intensity in any vertical
plane (the plane perpendicular to the horizontal plane) must equal or exceed
the appropriate value in Sec. 25.1393, where I is the minimum intensity
prescribed in Sec. 25.1391 for the corresponding angles in the horizontal
plane.
(3) Intensities in overlaps between adjacent signals. No intensity in any
overlap between adjacent signals may exceed the values given in Sec. 25.1395,
except that higher intensities in overlaps may be used with main beam
intensities substantially greater than the minima specified in Secs. 25.1391
and 25.1393 if the overlap intensities in relation to the main beam
intensities do not adversely affect signal clarity. When the peak intensity
of the forward position lights is more than 100 candles, the maximum overlap
intensities between them may exceed the values given in Sec. 25.1395 if the
overlap intensity in Area A is not more than 10 percent of peak position
light intensity and the overlap intensity in Area B is not greater than 2.5
percent of peak position light intensity.

their light will not impair the crew's vision or detract from the conspicuity
of the position lights; and
(2) Meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
(b) Field of coverage. The system must consist of enough lights to
illuminate the vital areas around the airplane considering the physical
configuration and flight characteristics of the airplane. The field of
coverage must extend in each direction within at least 75 degrees above and
75 degrees below the horizontal plane of the airplane, except that a solid
angle or angles of obstructed visibility totaling not more than 0.03
steradians is allowable within a solid angle equal to 0.15 steradians
centered about the longitudinal axis in the rearward direction.
(c) Flashing characteristics. The arrangement of the system, that is, the
number of light sources, beam width, speed of rotation, and other
characteristics, must give an effective flash frequency of not less than 40,
nor more than 100 cycles per minute. The effective flash frequency is the
frequency at which the airplane's complete anticollision light system is
observed from a distance, and applies to each sector of light including any
overlaps that exist when the system consists of more than one light source.
In overlaps, flash frequencies may exceed 100, but not 180 cycles per minute.
(d) Color. Each anticollision light must be either aviation red or aviation

                  INTEGRAL       I(t)dt
                    t1
                 Ie =
                 --------------
                 0.2+(t2-t1)

where:
Ie=effective intensity (candles).
I(t)=instantaneous intensity as a function of time.
t2--t1=flash time interval (seconds).

Normally, the maximum value of effective intensity is obtained when t2 and t1
are chosen so that the effective intensity is equal to the instantaneous
intensity at t2 and t1.
(f) Minimum effective intensities for anticollision lights. Each
anticollision light effective intensity must equal or exceed the applicable
values in the following table.

                  Angle above or    Effective

Criteria for determining minimum flight crew. The following are considered
by the Agency in determining the minimum flight crew under Sec. 25.1523:
(a) Basic workload functions. The following basic workload functions are
considered:
(1) Flight path control.
(2) Collision avoidance.
(3) Navigation.
(4) Communications.
(5) Operation and monitoring of aircraft engines and systems.
(6) Command decisions.
(b) Workload factors. The following workload factors are considered
significant when analyzing and demonstrating workload for minimum flight crew
determination:
(1) The accessibility, ease, and simplicity of operation of all necessary
flight, power, and equipment controls, including emergency fuel shutoff
valves, electrical controls, electronic controls, pressurization system
controls, and engine controls.
(2) The accessibility and conspicuity of all necessary instruments and
failure warning devices such as fire warning, electrical system malfunction,
and other failure or caution indicators. The extent to which such instruments
or devices direct the proper corrective action is also considered.
(3) The number, urgency, and complexity of operating procedures with
particular consideration given to the specific fuel management schedule
imposed by center of gravity, structural or other considerations of an
airworthiness nature, and to the ability of each engine to operate at all
times from a single tank or source which is automatically replenished if fuel
is also stored in other tanks.
(4) The degree and duration of concentrated mental and physical effort
involved in normal operation and in diagnosing and coping with malfunctions
and emergencies.
(5) The extent of required monitoring of the fuel, hydraulic,
pressurization, electrical, electronic, deicing, and other systems while en
route.
(6) The actions requiring a crewmember to be unavailable at his assigned
duty station, including: observation of systems, emergency operation of any
control, and emergencies in any compartment.
(7) The degree of automation provided in the aircraft systems to afford
(after failures or malfunctions) automatic crossover or isolation of
difficulties to minimize the need for flight crew action to guard against
loss of hydraulic or electric power to flight controls or to other essential
systems.
(8) The communications and navigation workload.
(9) The possibility of increased workload associated with any emergency
that may lead to other emergencies.
(10) Incapacitation of a flight crewmember whenever the applicable
operating rule requires a minimum flight crew of at least two pilots.
(c) Kind of operation authorized. The determination of the kind of
operation authorized requires consideration of the operating rules under
which the airplane will be operated. Unless an applicant desires approval for
a more limited kind of operation. It is assumed that each airplane
certificated under this Part will operate under IFR conditions.

                    Appendix E to Part 25

I--Limited Weight Credit For Airplanes Equipped With Standby Power

(a) Each applicant for an increase in the maximum certificated takeoff and
landing weights of an airplane equipped with a type-certificated standby
power rocket engine may obtain an increase as specified in paragraph (b) if--
(1) The installation of the rocket engine has been approved and it has been
established by flight test that the rocket engine and its controls can be
operated safely and reliably at the increase in maximum weight; and
(2) The Airplane Flight Manual, or the placard, markings or manuals
required in place thereof, set forth in addition to any other operating
limitations the Administrator may require, the increased weight approved
under this regulation and a prohibition against the operation of the airplane
at the approved increased weight when--
(i) The installed standby power rocket engines have been stored or
installed in excess of the time limit established by the manufacturer of the
rocket engine (usually stenciled on the engine casing); or
(ii) The rocket engine fuel has been expended or discharged.
(b) The currently approved maximum takeoff and landing weights at which an
airplane is certificated without a standby power rocket engine installation
may be increased by an amount that does not exceed any of the following:
(1) An amount equal in pounds to 0.014 IN, where I is the maximum usable
impulse in pounds-seconds available from each standby power rocket engine and
N is the number of rocket engines installed.
(2) An amount equal to 5 percent of the maximum certificated weight
approved in accordance with the applicable airworthiness regulations without
standby power rocket engines installed.
(3) An amount equal to the weight of the rocket engine installation.
(4) An amount that, together with the currently approved maximum weight,
would equal the maximum structural weight established for the airplane
without standby rocket engines installed.

II--Performance Credit for Transport Category Airplanes Equipped With Standby
Power

The Administrator may grant performance credit for the use of standby power
on transport category airplanes. However, the performance credit applies only
to the maximum certificated takeoff and landing weights, the takeoff
distance, and the takeoff paths, and may not exceed that found by the
Administrator to result in an overall level of safety in the takeoff,
approach, and landing regimes of flight equivalent to that prescribed in the
regulations under which the airplane was originally certificated without
standby power. For the purposes of this Appendix, "standby power" is power or
thrust, or both, obtained from rocket engines for a relatively short period
and actuated only in cases of emergency. The following provisions apply:
(1) Takeoff; general. The takeoff data prescribed in paragraphs (2) and (3)
of this Appendix must be determined at all weights and altitudes, and at
ambient temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit is to be
applied.
(2) Takeoff path.
(a) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path with standby power in use must
be determined in accordance with the performance requirements of the
applicable airworthiness regulations.
(b) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path (excluding that part where the
airplane is on or just above the takeoff surface) determined in accordance
with paragraph (a) of this section must lie above the one-engine-inoperative
takeoff path without standby power at the maximum takeoff weight at which all
of the applicable air-worthiness requirements are met. For the purpose of
this comparison, the flight path is considered to extend to at least a height
of 400 feet above the takeoff surface.
(c) The takeoff path with all engines operating, but without the use of
standby power, must reflect a conservatively greater overall level of
performance than the one-engine-inoperative takeoff path established in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The margin must be established
by the Administrator to insure safe day-to-day operations, but in no case may
it be less than 15 percent. The all-engines-operating takeoff path must be
determined by a procedure consistent with that established in complying with
paragraph (a) of this section.
(d) For reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes, the takeoff path to be
scheduled in the Airplane Flight Manual must represent the one-engine-
operative takeoff path determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
section and modified to reflect the procedure (see paragraph (6)) established
by the applicant for flap retraction and attainment of the en route speed.
The scheduled takeoff path must have a positive slope at all points of the
airborne portion and at no point must it lie above the takeoff path specified
in paragraph (a) of this section.
(3) Takeoff distance. The takeoff distance must be the horizontal distance
along the one-engine-inoperative take off path determined in accordance with
paragraph (2)(a) from the start of the takeoff to the point where the
airplane attains a height of 50 feet above the takeoff surface for
reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes and a height of 35 feet above the
takeoff surface for turbine-powered airplanes.
(4) Maximum certificated takeoff weights. The maximum certificated takeoff
weights must be determined at all altitudes, and at ambient temperatures, if
applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied and may not exceed
the weights established in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
section.
(a) The conditions of paragraphs (2) (b) through (d) must be met at the
maximum certificated takeoff weight.
(b) Without the use of standby power, the airplane must meet all of the en
route requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations under which
the airplane was originally certificated. In addition, turbine-powered
airplanes without the use of standby power must meet the final takeoff climb
requirements prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations.
(5) Maximum certificated landing weights.
(a) The maximum certificated landing weights (one-engine-inoperative
approach and all-engine-operating landing climb) must be determined at all
altitudes, and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which performance
credit is to be applied and must not exceed that established in compliance
with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) The flight path, with the engines operating at the power or thrust, or
both, appropriate to the airplane configuration and with standby power in
use, must lie above the flight path without standby power in use at the
maximum weight at which all of the applicable airworthiness requirements are
met. In addition, the flight paths must comply with subparagraphs (i) and
(ii) of this paragraph.
(i) The flight paths must be established without changing the appropriate
airplane configuration.
(ii) The flight paths must be carried out for a minimum height of 400 feet
above the point where standby power is actuated.
(6) Airplane configuration, speed, and power and thrust; general. Any
change in the airplane's configuration, speed, and power or thrust, or both,
must be made in accordance with the procedures established by the applicant
for the operation of the airplane in service and must comply with paragraphs
(a) through (c) of this section. In addition, procedures must be established
for the execution of balked landings and missed approaches.
(a) The Administrator must find that the procedure can be consistently
executed in service by crews of average skill.
(b) The procedure may not involve methods or the use of devices which have
not been proven to be safe and reliable.
(c) Allowances must be made for such time delays in the execution of the
procedures as may be reasonably expected to occur during service.
(7) Installation and operation; standby power. The standby power unit and
its installation must comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(a) The standby power unit and its installation must not adversely affect
the safety of the airplane.
(b) The operation of the standby power unit and its control must have
proven to be safe and reliable.

and pallets) used in each cargo and baggage compartment must be constructed
of materials that meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of part I of
this appendix.
(3) Electrical system components. Insulation on electrical wire or cable
installed in any area of the fuselage must be self-extinguishing when
subjected to the 60 degree test specified in part I of this appendix. The
average burn length may not exceed 3 inches, and the average flame time after
removal of the flame source may not exceed 30 seconds. Drippings from the
test specimen may not continue to flame for more than an average of 3 seconds
after falling.
(b) Test Procedures--(1) Conditioning. Specimens must be conditioned to
70+/-5 F., and at 50 percent +/-5 percent relative humidity until moisture
equilibrium is reached or for 24 hours. Each specimen must remain in the
conditioning environment until it is subjected to the flame.
(2) Specimen configuration. Except for small parts and electrical wire and
cable insulation, materials must be tested either as section cut from a
fabricated part as installed in the airplane or as a specimen simulating a
cut section, such as a specimen cut from a flat sheet of the material or a
model of the fabricated part. The specimen may be cut from any location in a
fabricated part; however, fabricated units, such as sandwich panels, may not
be separated for test. Except as noted below, the specimen thickness must be
no thicker than the minimum thickness to be qualified for use in the
airplane. Test specimens of thick foam parts, such as seat cushions, must be
 -inch in thickness. Test specimens of materials that must meet the
requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of part I of this appendix must be no
more than 1/8 -inch in thickness. Electrical wire and cable specimens must be
the same size as used in the airplane. In the case of fabrics, both the warp
and fill direction of the weave must be tested to determine the most critical
flammability condition. Specimens must be mounted in a metal frame so that
the two long edges and the upper edge are held securely during the vertical
test prescribed in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph and the two long edges
and the edge away from the flame are held securely during the horizontal test
prescribed in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. The exposed area of the
specimen must be at least 2 inches wide and 12 inches long, unless the actual
size used in the airplane is smaller. The edge to which the burner flame is
applied must not consist of the finished or protected edge of the specimen
but must be representative of the actual cross-section of the material or
part as installed in the airplane. The specimen must be mounted in a metal
frame so that all four edges are held securely and the exposed area of the
specimen is at least 8 inches by 8 inches during the 45 deg. test prescribed
in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.
(3) Apparatus. Except as provided in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph,
tests must be conducted in a draft-free cabinet in accordance with Federal
Test Method Standard 191 Model 5903 (revised Method 5902) for the vertical
test, or Method 5906 for horizontal test (available from the General Services
Administration, Business Service Center, Region 3, Seventh & D Streets SW.,
Washington, DC 20407). Specimens which are too large for the cabinet must be
tested in similar draft-free conditions.
(4) Vertical test. A minimum of three specimens must be tested and results
averaged. For fabrics, the direction of weave corresponding to the most
critical flammability conditions must be parallel to the longest dimension.
Each specimen must be supported vertically. The specimen must be exposed to a
Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal 3/8 -inch I.D. tube adjusted to give
a flame of 1   inches in height. The minimum flame temperature measured by
a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer in the center of the flame must be 1550
deg.F. The lower edge of the specimen must be 3/4 -inch above the top edge of
the burner. The flame must be applied to the center line of the lower edge of
the specimen. For materials covered by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of part I of this
appendix, the flame must be applied for 60 seconds and then removed. For
materials covered by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of part I of this appendix, the
flame must be applied for 12 seconds and then removed. Flame time, burn
length, and flaming time of drippings, if any, may be recorded. The burn
length determined in accordance with subparagraph (7) of this paragraph must
be measured to the nearest tenth of an inch.
(5) Horizontal test. A minimum of three specimens must be tested and the
results averaged. Each specimen must be supported horizontally. The exposed
surface, when installed in the aircraft, must be face down for the test. The
specimen must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal 3/8 -
inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of 1   inches in height. The
minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer in
the center of the flame must be 1550 deg.F. The specimen must be positioned
so that the edge being tested is centered 3/4 -inch above the top of the
burner. The flame must be applied for 15 seconds and then removed. A minimum
of 10 inches of specimen must be used for timing purposes, approximately 1
  inches must burn before the burning front reaches the timing zone, and
the average burn rate must be recorded.
(6) Forty-five degree test. A minimum of three specimens must be tested and
the results averaged. The specimens must be supported at an angle of 45 deg.
to a horizontal surface. The exposed surface when installed in the aircraft
must be face down for the test. The specimens must be exposed to a Bunsen or
Tirrill burner with a nominal 3/8 -inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame of
1   inches in height. The minimum flame temperature measured by a
calibrated thermocouple pyrometer in the center of the flame must be 1550
deg.F. Suitable precautions must be taken to avoid drafts. The flame must be
applied for 30 seconds with one-third contacting the material at the center
of the specimen and then removed. Flame time, glow time, and whether the
flame penetrates (passes through) the specimen must be recorded.
(7) Sixty degree test. A minimum of three specimens of each wire
specification (make and size) must be tested. The specimen of wire or cable
(including insulation) must be placed at an angle of 60 deg. with the
horizontal in the cabinet specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph
with the cabinet door open during the test, or must be placed within a
chamber approximately 2 feet high by 1 foot by 1 foot, open at the top and at
one vertical side (front), and which allows sufficient flow of air for
complete combustion, but which is free from drafts. The specimen must be
parallel to and approximately 6 inches from the front of the chamber. The
lower end of the specimen must be held rigidly clamped. The upper end of the
specimen must pass over a pulley or rod and must have an appropriate weight
attached to it so that the specimen is held tautly throughout the
flammability test. The test specimen span between lower clamp and upper
pulley or rod must be 24 inches and must be marked 8 inches from the lower
end to indicate the central point for flame application. A flame from a
Bunsen or Tirrill burner must be applied for 30 seconds at the test mark. The
burner must be mounted underneath the test mark on the specimen,
perpendicular to the specimen and at an angle of 30 deg. to the vertical
plane of the specimen. The burner must have a nominal bore of 3/8 -inch and
be adjusted to provide a 3-inch high flame with an inner cone approximately
one-third of the flame height. The minimum temperature of the hottest portion
of the flame, as measured with a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer, may not
be less than 1750 deg.F. The burner must be positioned so that the hottest
portion of the flame is applied to the test mark on the wire. Flame time,
burn length, and flaming time of drippings, if any, must be recorded. The
burn length determined in accordance with paragraph (8) of this paragraph
must be measured to the nearest tenth of an inch. Breaking of the wire
specimens is not considered a failure.
(8) Burn length. Burn length is the distance from the original edge to the
farthest evidence of damage to the test specimen due to flame impingement,
including areas of partial or complete consumption, charring, or
embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, warped, or
discolored, nor areas where material has shrunk or melted away from the heat
source.

           Part II--Flammability of Seat Cushions

(a) Criteria for Acceptance. Each seat cushion must meet the following
criteria:
(1) At least three sets of seat bottom and seat back cushion specimens must
be tested.
(2) If the cushion is constructed with a fire blocking material, the fire
blocking material must completely enclose the cushion foam core material.
(3) Each specimen tested must be fabricated using the principal components
(i.e., foam core, flotation material, fire blocking material, if used, and
dress covering) and assembly processes (representative seams and closures)
intended for use in the production articles. If a different material
combination is used for the back cushion than for the bottom cushion, both
material combinations must be tested as complete specimen sets, each set
consisting of a back cushion specimen and a bottom cushion specimen. If a
cushion, including outer dress covering, is demonstrated to meet the
requirements of this appendix using the oil burner test, the dress covering
of that cushion may be replaced with a similar dress covering provided the
burn length of the replacement covering, as determined by the test specified
in Sec. 25.853(c), does not exceed the corresponding burn length of the dress
covering used on the cushion subjected to the oil burner test.
(4) For at least two-thirds of the total number of specimen sets tested,
the burn length from the burner must not reach the side of the cushion
opposite the burner. The burn length must not exceed 17 inches. Burn length
is the perpendicular distance from the inside edge of the seat frame closest
to the burner to the farthest evidence of damage to the test specimen due to
flame impingement, including areas of partial or complete consumption,
charring, or embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, warped,
or discolored, or areas where material has shrunk or melted away from the
heat source.
(5) The average percentage weight loss must not exceed 10 percent. Also, at
least two-thirds of the total number of specimen sets tested must not exceed
10 percent weight loss. All droppings falling from the cushions and mounting
stand are to be discarded before the after-test weight is determined. The
percentage weight loss for a specimen set is the weight of the specimen set
before testing less the weight of the specimen set after testing expressed as
the percentage of the weight before testing.
(b) Test Conditions. Vertical air velocity should average 25 fpm+/-10 fpm
at the top of the back seat cushion. Horizontal air velocity should be below
10 fpm just above the bottom seat cushion. Air velocities should be measured
with the ventilation hood operating and the burner motor off.
(c) Test Specimens. (1) For each test, one set of cushion specimens
representing a seat bottom and seat back cushion must be used.
(2) The seat bottom cushion specimen must be 18+/- 1/8  inches (457+/-3 mm)
wide by 20+/- 1/8  inches (508+/-3 mm) deep by 4+/- 1/8  inches (102+/-3 mm)
thick, exclusive of fabric closures and seam overlap.
(3) The seat back cushion specimen must be 18+/- 1/8  inches (432+/-3 mm)
wide by 25+/- 1/8  inches (635+/-3 mm) high by 2+/- 1/8  inches (51+/-3 mm)
thick, exclusive of fabric closures and seam overlap.
(4) The specimens must be conditioned at 70+/-5  deg.F (21+/-2  deg.C)
55%+/-10% relative humidity for at least 24 hours before testing.
(d) Test Apparatus. The arrangement of the test apparatus is shown in
Figures 1 through 5 and must include the components described in this
section. Minor details of the apparatus may vary, depending on the model
burner used.
(1) Specimen Mounting Stand. The mounting stand for the test specimens
consists of steel angles, as shown in Figure 1. The length of the mounting
stand legs is 12+/- 1/8  inches (305+/-3 mm). The mounting stand must be used
for mounting the test specimen seat bottom and seat back, as shown in Figure
2. The mounting stand should also include a suitable drip pan lined with
aluminum foil, dull side up.
(2) Test Burner. The burner to be used in testing must--
(i) Be a modified gun type;
(ii) Have an 80-degree spray angle nozzle nominally rated for 2.25 gallons/
hour at 100 psi;
(iii) Have a 12-inch (305 mm) burner cone installed at the end of the draft
tube, with an opening 6 inches (152 mm) high and 11 inches (280 mm) wide, as
shown in Figure 3; and
(iv) Have a burner fuel pressure regulator that is adjusted to deliver a
nominal 2.0 gallon/hour of NZ 2 Grade kerosene or equivalent required for the
test.

Burner models which have been used successfully in testing are the Lennox
Model OB-32, Carlin Model 200 CRD, and Park Model DPL 3400. FAA published
reports pertinent to this type of burner are: (1) Powerplant Enginering
Report No. 3A, Standard Fire Test Apparatus and Procedure for Flexible Hose
Assemblies, dated March 1978; and (2) Report No. DOT/FAA/RD/76/213,
Reevaluation of Burner Characteristics for Fire Resistance Tests, dated
January 1977.
(3) Calorimeter.
(i) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a (0-15.0 BTU/ft2-sec. 0-
17.0 w/cm**2) calorimeter, accurate +/-3%, mounted in a 6-inch by 12-inch
(152 by 305 mm) by 3/4 -inch (19 mm) thick calcium silicate insulating board
which is attached to a steel angle bracket for placement in the test stand
during burner calibration, as shown in Figure 4.
(ii) Because crumbling of the insulating board with service can result in
misalignment of the calorimeter, the calorimeter must be monitored and the
mounting shimmed, as necessary, to ensure that the calorimeter face is flush
with the exposed plane of the insulating board in a plane parallel to the
exit of the test burner cone.
(4) Thermocouples. The seven thermocouples to be used for testing must be
1/16 - to 1/8 -inch metal sheathed, ceramic packed, type K, grounded
thermocouples with a nominal 22 to 30 American wire gage (AWG)-size
conductor. The seven thermocouples must be attached to a steel angle bracket
to form a thermocouple rake for placement in the test stand during burner
calibration, as shown in Figure 5.
(5) Apparatus Arrangement. The test burner must be mounted on a suitable
stand to position the exit of the burner cone a distance of 4+/- 1/8  inches
(102+/-3 mm) from one side of the specimen mounting stand. The burner stand
should have the capability of allowing the burner to be swung away from the
specimen mounting stand during warmup periods.
(6) Data Recording. A recording potentiometer or other suitable calibrated
instrument with an appropriate range must be used to measure and record the
outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouples.
(7) Weight Scale. Weighing Device--A device must be used that with proper
procedures may determine the before and after test weights of each set of
seat cushion specimens within 0.02 pound (9 grams). A continuous weighing
system is preferred.
(8) Timing Device. A stopwatch or other device (calibrated to +/-1 second)
must be used to measure the time of application of the burner flame and self-
extinguishing time or test duration.
(e) Preparation of Apparatus. Before calibration, all equipment must be
turned on and the burner fuel must be adjusted as specified in paragraph
(d)(2).
(f) Calibration. To ensure the proper thermal output of the burner, the
following test must be made:
(1) Place the calorimeter on the test stand as shown in Figure 4 at a
distance of 4+/- 1/8  inches (102+/-3 mm) from the exit of the burner cone.
(2) Turn on the burner, allow it to run for 2 minutes for warmup, and
adjust the burner air intake damper to produce a reading of 10.5+/-0.5 BTU/
ft2-sec. (11.9+/-0.6 w/cm**2) on the calorimeter to ensure steady state
conditions have been achieved. Turn off the burner.
(3) Replace the calorimeter with the thermocouple rake (Figure 5).
(4) Turn on the burner and ensure that the thermocouples are reading
1900+/-100  deg.F (1038+/-38  deg.C) to ensure steady state conditions have
been achieved.
(5) If the calorimeter and thermocouples do not read within range, repeat
steps in paragraphs 1 through 4 and adjust the burner air intake damper until
the proper readings are obtained. The thermocouple rake and the calorimeter
should be used frequently to maintain and record calibrated test parameters.
Until the specific apparatus has demonstrated consistency, each test should
be calibrated. After consistency has been confirmed, several tests may be
conducted with the pre-test calibration before and a calibration check after
the series.
(g) Test Procedure. The flammability of each set of specimens must be
tested as follows:
(1) Record the weight of each set of seat bottom and seat back cushion
specimens to be tested to the nearest 0.02 pound (9 grams).
(2) Mount the seat bottom and seat back cushion test specimens on the test
stand as shown in Figure 2, securing the seat back cushion specimen to the
test stand at the top.
(3) Swing the burner into position and ensure that the distance from the
exit of the burner cone to the side of the seat bottom cushion specimen is
4+/- 1/8  inches (102+/-3 mm).
(4) Swing the burner away from the test position. Turn on the burner and
allow it to run for 2 minutes to provide adequate warmup of the burner cone
and flame stabilization.
(5) To begin the test, swing the burner into the test position and
simultaneously start the timing device.
(6) Expose the seat bottom cushion specimen to the burner flame for 2
minutes and then turn off the burner. Immediately swing the burner away from
the test position. Terminate test 7 minutes after initiating cushion exposure
to the flame by use of a gaseous extinguishing agent (i.e., Halon or CO2).
(7) Determine the weight of the remains of the seat cushion specimen set
left on the mounting stand to the nearest 0.02 pound (9 grams) excluding all
droppings.
(h) Test Report. With respect to all specimen sets tested for a particular
seat cushion for which testing of compliance is performed, the following
information must be recorded:
(1) An identification and description of the specimens being tested.
(2) The number of specimen sets tested.
(3) The initial weight and residual weight of each set, the calculated
percentage weight loss of each set, and the calculated average percentage
weight loss for the total number of sets tested.
(4) The burn length for each set tested.

Part III--Test Method to Determine Flame Penetration Resistance of Cargo
Compartment Liners.

(a) Criteria for Acceptance. (1) At least three specimens of cargo
compartment sidewall or ceiling liner panels must be tested.
(2) Each specimen tested must simulate the cargo compartment sidewall or
ceiling liner panel, including any design features, such as joints, lamp
assemblies, etc., the failure of which would affect the capability of the
liner to safey contain a fire.
(3) There must be no flame penetration of any specimen within 5 minutes
after application of the flame source, and the peak temperature measured at 4
inches above the upper surface of the horizontal test sample must not exceed
400  deg.F.
(b) Summary of Method. This method provides a laboratory test procedure for
measuring the capability of cargo compartment lining materials to resist
flame penetration with a 2 gallon per hour (GPH) NZ2 Grade kerosene or
equivalent burner fire source. Ceiling and sidewall liner panels may be
tested individually provided a baffle is used to simulate the missing panel.
Any specimen that passes the test as a ceiling liner panel may be used as a
sidewall liner panel.
(c) Test Specimens. (1) The specimen to be tested must measure 16+/- 1/8
inches (406+/-3 mm) by 24+1/8  inches (610+/-3 mm).
(2) The specimens must be conditioned at 70  deg.F.+/-5  deg.F. (21
deg.C.+/-2  deg.C.) and 55%+/-5% humidity for at least 24 hours before
testing.
(d) Test Apparatus. The arrangement of the test apparatus, which is shown
in Figure 3 of Part II and Figures 1 through 3 of this part of Appendix F,
must include the components described in this section. Minor details of the
apparatus may vary, depending on the model of the burner used.
(1) Specimen Mounting Stand. The mounting stand for the test specimens
consists of steel angles as shown in Figure 1.
(2) Test Burner. The burner to be used in tesing must--
(i) Be a modified gun type.
(ii) Use a suitable nozzle and maintain fuel pressure to yield a 2 GPH fuel
flow. For example: an 80 degree nozzle nominally rated at 2.25 GPH and
operated at 85 pounds per square inch (PSI) gage to deliver 2.03 GPH.
(iii) Have a 12 inch (305 mm) burner extension installed at the end of the
draft tube with an opening 6 inches (152 mm) high and 11 inches (280 mm) wide
as shown in Figure 3 of Part II of this appendix.
(iv) Have a burner fuel pressure regulator that is adjusted to deliver a
nominal 2.0 GPH of NZ2 Grade kerosene or equivalent.
Burner models which have been used successfully in testing are the Lenox
Model OB-32, Carlin Model 200 CRD and Park Model DPL. The basic burner is
described in FAA Powerplant Engineering Report No. 3A, Standard Fire Test
Apparatus and Procedure for Flexible Hose Assemblies, dated March 1978;
however, the test settings specified in this appendix differ in some
instances from those specified in the report.
(3) Calorimeter. (i) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a total
heat flux Foil Type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range (approximately 0 to
15.0 British thermal unit (BTU) per ft.2 sec., 0-17.0 watts/cm**2). The
calorimeter must be mounted in a 6 inch by 12 inch (152 by 305 mm) by 3/4
inch (19 mm) thick insulating block which is attached to a steel angle
bracket for placement in the test stand during burner calibration as shown in
Figure 2 of this part of this appendix.
(ii) The insulating block must be monitored for deterioration and the
mounting shimmed as necessary to ensure that the calorimeter face is parallel
to the exit plane of the test burner cone.
(4) Thermocouples. The seven thermocouples to be used for testing must be
1/16  inch ceramic sheathed, type K, grounded thermocouples with a nominal 30
American wire gage (AWG) size conductor. The seven thermocouples must be
attached to a steel angle bracket to form a thermocouple rake for placement
in the test stand during burner calibration as shown in Figure 3 of this part
of this appendix.
(5) Apparatus Arrangement. The test burner must be mounted on a suitable
stand to position the exit of the burner cone a distance of 8 inches from the
ceiling liner panel and 2 inches from the sidewall liner panel. The burner
stand should have the capability of allowing the burner to be swung away from
the test specimen during warm-up periods.
(6) Instrumentation. A recording potentiometer or other suitable instrument
with an appropriate range must be used to measure and record the outputs of
the calorimeter and the thermocouples.
(7) Timing Device. A stopwatch or other device must be used to measure the
time of flame application and the time of flame penetration, if it occurs.
(e) Preparation of Apparatus. Before calibration, all equipment must be
turned on and allowed to stabilize, and the burner fuel flow must be adjusted
as specified in paragraph (d)(2).
(f) Calibration. To ensure the proper thermal output of the burner the
following test must be made:
(1) Remove the burner extension from the end of the draft tube. Turn on the
blower portion of the burner without turning the fuel or igniters on. Measure
the air velocity using a hot wire anemometer in the center of the draft tube
across the face of the opening. Adjust the damper such that the air velocity
is in the range of 1550 to 1800 ft./min. If tabs are being used at the exit
of the draft tube, they must be removed prior to this measurement. Reinstall
the draft tube extension cone.
(2) Place the calorimeter on the test stand as shown in Figure 2 at a
distance of 8 inches (203 mm) from the exit of the burner cone to simulate
the position of the horizontal test specimen.
(3) Turn on the burner, allow it to run for 2 minutes for warm-up, and
adjust the damper to produce a calorimeter reading of 8.0+/-0.5 BTU per ft.2
sec. (9.1+/-0.6 Watts/cm**2).
(4) Replace the calorimeter with the thermocouple rake (see Figure 3).
(5) Turn on the burner and ensure that each of the seven thermocouples
reads 1700  deg.F. +/-100  deg.F. (927  deg.C. +/-38  deg.C.) to ensure
steady state conditions have been achieved. If the temperature is out of this
range, repeat steps 2 through 5 until proper readings are obtained.
(6) Turn off the burner and remove the thermocouple rake.
(7) Repeat (1) to ensure that the burner is in the correct range.
(g) Test Procedure. (1) Mount a thermocouple of the same type as that used
for calibration at a distance of 4 inches (102 mm) above the horizontal
(ceiling) test specimen. The thermocouple should be centered over the burner
cone.
(2) Mount the test specimen on the test stand shown in Figure 1 in either
the horizontal or vertical position. Mount the insulating material in the
other position.
(3) Position the burner so that flames will not impinge on the specimen,
turn the burner on, and allow it to run for 2 minutes. Rotate the burner to
apply the flame to the specimen and simultaneously start the timing device.
(4) Expose the test specimen tto the flame for 5 minutes and then turn off
the burner. The test may be terminated earlier if flame penetration is
observed.
(5) When testing ceiling liner panels, record the peak temperature measured
4 inches above the sample.
(6) Record the time at which flame penetration occurs if applicable.
(h) Test Report. The test report must include the following:
(1) A complete description of the materials tested including type,
manufacturer, thickness, and other appropriate data.
(2) Observations of the behavior of the test specimens during flame
exposure such as delamination, resin ignition, smoke, ect., including the
time of such occurrence.

Part IV--Test Method to Determine the Heat Release Rate From Cabin Materials
Exposed to Radiant Heat.

(a) Summary of Method. Three or more specimens representing the completed
aircraft component are tested. Each test specimen is injected into an
environmental chamber through which a constant flow of air passes. The
specimen's exposure is determined by a radiant heat source adjusted to
produce, on the specimen, the desired total heat flux of 3.5 W/cm2. The
specimen is tested with the exposed surface vertical. Combustion is initiated
by piloted ignition. The combustion products leaving the chamber are
monitored in order to calculate the release rate of heat.
(b) Apparatus. The Ohio State University (OSU) rate of heat release
apparatus, as described below, is used. This is a modified version of the
rate of heat release apparatus standardized by the American Society of
Testing and Materials (ASTM), ASTM E-906.
(1) This apparatus is shown in Figures 1A and 1B of this part IV. All
exterior surfaces of the apparatus, except the holding chamber, must be
insulated with 1 inch (25 mm) thick, low density, high temperature,
fiberglass board insulation. A gasketed door, through which the sample
injection rod slides, must be used to form an airtight closure on the
specimen hold chamber.
(2) Thermopile. The temperature difference between the air entering the
environmental chamber and that leaving must be monitored by a thermopile
having five hot, and five cold, 24-guage Chromel-Alumel junctions. The hot
junctions must be spaced across the top of the exhaust stack, .38 inches (10
mm) below the top of the chimney. The thermocouples must have a .050 +/- .010
inch (1.3 +/- .3mm) diameter, ball-type, welded tip. One thermocouple must be
located in the geometric center, with the other four located 1.18 inch (30
mm) from the center along the diagonal toward each of the corners (Figure 5
of this part IV). The cold junctions must be located in the pan below the
lower air distribution plate (see paragraph (b)(4) of this part IV).
Thermopile hot junctions must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to
maintain the calibrated sensitivity.
(3) Radiation Source. A radiant heat source incorporating four Type LL
silicon carbide elements, 20 inches (508 mm) long by .63 inch (16 mm) O.D.,
must be used, as shown in Figures 2A and 2B of this part IV. The heat source
must have a nominal resistance of 1.4 ohms and be capable of generating a
flux up to 100 kW/m/2/. The silicone carbide elements must be mounted in the
stainless steel panel box by inserting them through .63 inch (16 mm) holes in
.03 inch (1 mm) thick ceramic fiber or calcium-silicate millboard. Locations
of the holes in the pads and stainless steel cover plates are shown in Figure
2B of this part IV. The truncated diamond-shaped mask of .042 +/- .002 inch
(1.07 +/- .05mm) stainless steel must be added to provide uniform heat flux
density over the area occupied by the vertical sample.
(4) Air Distribution System. The air entering the environmental chamber
must be distributed by a .25 inch (6.3 mm) thick aluminum plate having eight
No. 4 drill-holes, located 2 inches (51 mm) from sides on 4 inch (102 mm)
centers, mounted at the base of the environmental chamber. A second plate of
18 guage stainless steel having 120, evenly spaced, No. 28 drill holes must
be mounted 6 inches (152 mm) above the aluminum plate. A well-regulated air
supply is required. The air-supply manifold at the base of the pyramidal
section must have 48, evenly spaced, No. 26 drill holes located .38 inch (10
mm) from the inner edge of the manifold, resulting in an airflow split of
approximately three to one within the apparatus.
(5) Exhaust Stack. An exhaust stack, 5.25 x 2.75 inches (133 x 70 mm) in
cross section, and 10 inches (254 mm) long, fabricated from 28 guage
stainless steel must be mounted on the outlet of the pyramidal section. A.
1.0 x 3.0 inch (25 x 76 mm) baffle plate of .018 +/- .002 inch (.50 +/- .05
mm) stainless steel must be centered inside the stack, perpendicular to the
air flow, 3 inches (76 mm) above the base of the stack.
(6) Specimen Holders. (i) The specimen must be tested in a vertical
orientation. The specimen holder (Figure 3 of this part IV) must incorporate
a frame that touches the specimen (which is wrapped with aluminum foil as
required by paragraph (d)(3) of this Part) along only the .25 inch (6 mm)
perimeter. A "V" shaped spring is used to hold the assembly together. A
detachable .50 x .50 x 5.91 inch (12 x 12 x 150 mm) drip pan and two .020
inch (.5 mm) stainless steel wires (as shown in Figure 3 of this part IV)
must be used for testing materials prone to melting and dripping. The
positioning of the spring and frame may be changed to accommodate different
specimen thicknesses by inserting the retaining rod in different holes on the
specimen holder.
(ii) Since the radiation shield described in ASTM E-906 is not used, a
guide pin must be added to the injection mechanism. This fits into a slotted
metal plate on the injection mechanism outside of the holding chamber. It can
be used to provide accurate positioning of the specimen face after injection.
The front surface of the specimen must be 3.9 inches (100 mm) from the closed
radiation doors after injection.
(iii) The specimen holder clips onto the mounted bracket (Figure 3 of this
part IV). The mounting bracket must be attached to the injection rod by three
screws that pass through a wide-area washer welded onto a 1/2 -inch (13 mm)
nut. The end of the injection rod must be threaded to screw into the nut, and
a .020 inch (5.1 mm) thick wide area washer must be held between two 1/2 -
inch (13 mm) nuts that are adjusted to tightly cover the hole in the
radiation doors through which the injection rod or calibration calorimeter
pass.
(7) Calorimeter. A total-flux type calorimeter must be mounted in the
center of a 1/2 -inch Kaowool "M" board inserted in the sample holder to
measure the total heat flux. The calorimeter must have a view angle of 180
degrees and be calibrated for incident flux. The calorimeter calibration must
be acceptable to the Administrator.
(8) Pilot-Flame Positions. Pilot ignition of the specimen must be
accomplished by simultaneously exposing the specimen to a lower pilot burner
and an upper pilot burner, as described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) and (b)(8)(ii)
or (b)(8)(iii) of this part IV, respectively. Since intermittent pilot flame
extinguishment for more than 3 seconds would invalidate the test results, a
spark ignitor may be installed to ensure that the lower pilot burner remains
lighted.
(i) Lower Pilot Burner. The pilot-flame tubing must be .25 inch (6.3 mm)
O.D., .03 inch (0.8mm) wall, stainless steel tubing. A mixture of 120
cm3/min. of methane and 850 cm3/min. of air must be fed to the lower pilot
flame burner. The normal position of the end of the pilot burner tubing is
.40 inch (10 mm) from and perpendicular to the exposed vertical surface of
the specimen. The centerline at the outlet of the burner tubing must
intersect the vertical centerline of the sample at a point .20 inch (5 mm)
above the lower exposed edge of the specimen.
(ii) Standard Three-Hole Upper Pilot Burner. The pilot burner must be a
straight length of .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, stainless
steel tubing that is 14 inches (360 mm) long. One end of the tubing must be
closed, and three No. 40 drill holes must be drilled into the tubing, 2.38
inch (60 mm) apart, for gas ports, all radiating in the same direction. The
first hole must be .19 inch (5 mm) from the closed end of the tubing. The
tube must be positioned .75 inch (19 mm) above and .75 inch (19 mm) behind
the exposed upper edge of the specimen. The middle hole must be in the
vertical plane perpendicular to the exposed surface of the specimen which
passes through its vertical centerline and must be pointed toward the
radiation source. The gas supplied to the burner must be methane and must be
adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm).
(iii) Optional Fourteen-Hole Upper Pilot Burner. This burner may be used in
lieu of the standard three-hole burner described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of
this part IV. The pilot burner must be a straight length of .25 inch (6.3 mm)
O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, stainless steel tubing that is 15.75 inches
(400 mm) long. One end of the tubing must be closed, and 14 No. 59 drill
holes must be drilled into the tubing, .50 inch (13 mm) apart, for gas ports,
all radiating in the same direction. The first hole must be .50 inch (13 mm)
from the closed end of the tubing. The tube must be positioned above the
specimen holder so that the holes are placed above the specimen as shown in
Figure 1B of this part IV. The fuel supplied to the burner must be methane
mixed with air in a ratio of approximately 50/50 by volume. The total gas
flow must be adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm). When the
gas/air ratio and the flow rate are properly adjusted, approximately .25 inch
(6 mm) of the flame length appears yellow in color.
(c) Calibration of Equipment. (1) Heat Release Rate. A calibration burner,
as shown in Figure 4, must be placed over the end of the lower pilot flame
tubing using a gas tight connection. The flow of gas to the pilot flame must
be at least 99 percent methane and must be accurately metered. Prior to
usage, the wet test meter must be properly leveled and filled with distilled
water to the tip of the internal pointer while no gas is flowing. Ambient
temperature and pressure of the water are based on the internal wet test
meter temperature. A baseline flow rate of approximately 1 liter/min. must be
set and increased to higher preset flows of 4, 6, 8, 6 and 4 liters/min.
Immediately prior to recording methane flow rates, a flow rate of 8
liters/min. must be used for 2 minutes to precondition the chamber. This is
not recorded as part of calibration. The rate must be determined by using a
stopwatch to time a complete revolution of the wet test meter for both the
baseline and higher flow, with the flow returned to baseline before changing
to the next higher flow. The thermopile baseline voltage must be measured.
The gas flow to the burner must be increased to the higher preset flow and
allowed to burn for 2.0 minutes, and the thermopile voltage must be measured.
The sequence must be repeated until all five values have been determined. The
average of the five values must be used as the calibration factor. The
procedure must be repeated if the percent relative standard deviation is
greater than 5 percent. Calculations are shown in paragraph (f) of this part
IV.
(2) Flux Uniformity. Uniformity of flux over the specimen must be checked
periodically and after each heating element change to determine if it is
within acceptable limits of plus or minus 5 percent.
(3) As noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this part IV, thermopile hot junctions
must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to maintain the calibrated
sensitivity.
(d) Preparation of Test Specimens. (1) The test specimens must be
representative of the aircraft component in regard to materials and
construction methods. The standard size for the test specimens is 5.91 +/-
.03 x 5.91 +/- .03 inches (149 +/- 1 x 149 +/- 1 mm). The thickness of the
specimen must be the same as that of the aircraft component it represents up
to a maximum thickness of 1.75 inches (45 mm). Test specimens representing
thicker components must be 1.75 inches (45 mm).
(2) Conditioning. Specimens must be conditioned as described in Part 1 of
this appendix.
(3) Mounting. Each test specimen must be wrapped tightly on all sides of
the specimen, except for the one surface that is exposed with a single layer
of .001 inch (.025 mm) aluminum foil.
(e) Procedure. (1) The power supply to the radiant panel must be set to
produce a radiant flux of 3.5 +/- .05 W/cm2, as measured at the point the
center of the specimen surface will occupy when positioned for the test. The
radiant flux must be measured after the air flow through the equipment is
adjusted to the desired rate.
(2) After the pilot flames are lighted, their position must be checked as
described in paragraph (b)(8) of this part IV.
(3) Air flow through the apparatus must be controlled by a circular plate
orifice located in a 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) I.D. pipe with two pressure measuring
points, located 1.5 inches (38 mm) upstream and .75 inches (19 mm) downstream
of the orifice plate. The pipe must be connected to a manometer set at a
pressure differential of 7.87 inches (200 mm) of Hg. (See Figure 1B of this
part IV.) The total air flow to the equipment is approximately .04
m3/seconds. The stop on the vertical specimen holder rod must be adjusted so
that the exposed surface of the specimen is positioned 3.9 inches (100 mm)
from the entrance when injected into the environmental chamber.
(4) The specimen must be placed in the hold chamber with the radiation
doors closed. The airtight outer door must be secured, and the recording
devices must be started. The specimen must be retained in the hold chamber
for 60 seconds, plus or minus 10 seconds, before injection. The thermopile
"zero" value must be determined during the last 20 seconds of the hold
period. The sample must not be injected before completion of the "zero" value
determination.
(5) When the specimen is to be injected, the radiation doors must be
opened. After the specimen is injected into the environmental chamber, the
radiation doors must be closed behind the specimen.
(6) [Reserved]
(7) Injection of the specimen and closure of the inner door marks time
zero. A record of the thermopile output with at least one data point per
second must be made during the time the specimen is in the environmental
chamber.
(8) The test duration is five minutes. The lower pilot burner and the upper
pilot burner must remain lighted for the entire duration of the test, except
that there may be intermittent flame extinguishment for periods that do not
exceed 3 seconds. Furthermore, if the optional three-hole upper burner is
used, at least two flamelets must remain lighted for the entire duration of
the test, except that there may be intermittent flame extinguishment of all
three flamelets for periods that do not exceed 3 seconds.
(9) A minimum of three specimens must be tested.
(f) Calculations. (1) The calibration factor is calculated as follows:

             [ ...Illustration appears here... ]

                Formula for Calibration Factor

F0=flow of methane at baseline (1pm)
F1=higher preset flow of methane (1pm)
V0=thermopile voltage at baseline (mv)
V1=thermopile voltage at higher flow (mv)
Ta=Ambient temperature (K)
P=Ambient pressure (mm Hg)
Pv=Water vapor pressure (mm Hg)

(2) Heat release rates may be calculated from the reading of the thermopile
output voltage at any instant of time as:

                            (Vm - Vb)Kh
                      HRR = -----------
                            .02323m**2

HRR=heat release rate (kw/m**2)
Vb=baseline voltage (mv)
Vm=measured thermopile voltage (mv)
Kh=calibration factor (kw/mv)
(3) The integral of the heat release rate is the total heat release as a
function of time and is calculated by multiplying the rate by the data
sampling frequency in minutes and summing the time from zero to two minutes.
(g) Criteria. The total positive heat release over the first two minutes of
exposure for each of the three or more samples tested must be averaged, and
the peak heat release rate for each of the samples must be averaged. The
average total heat release must not exceed 65 kilowatt-minutes per square
meter, and the average peak heat release rate must not exceed 65 kilowatts
per square meter.
(h) Report. The test report must include the following for each specimen
tested:
(1) Description of the specimen.
(2) Radiant heat flux to the specimen, expressed in W/cm**2.
(3) Data giving release rates of heat (in kW/m**2 ) as a function of time,
either graphically or tabulated at intervals no greater than 10 seconds. The
calibration factor (kn) must be recorded.
(4) If melting, sagging, delaminating, or other behavior that affects the
exposed surface area or the mode of burning occurs, these behaviors must be
reported, together with the time at which such behaviors were observed.
(5) The peak heat release and the 2-minute integrated heat release rate
must be reported.

   Appendix G to Part 25--Continuous Gust Design Criteria

The continuous gust design criteria in this appendix must be used in
establishing the dynamic response of the airplane to vertical and lateral
continuous turbulence unless a more rational criteria is used. The following
gust load requirements apply to mission analysis and design envelope
analysis:
(a) The limit gust loads utilizing the continuous turbulence concept must
be determined in accordance with the provisions of either paragraph (b) or
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this appendix.
(b) Design envelope analysis. The limit loads must be determined in
accordance with the following:
(1) All critical altitudes, weights, and weight distributions, as specified
in Sec. 25.321(b), and all critical speeds within the ranges indicated in
paragraph (b)(3) of this appendix must be considered.
(2) Values of A (ratio of root-mean-square incremental load root-mean-
square gust velocity) must be determined by dynamic analysis. The power
spectral density of the atmospheric turbulence must be as given by the
equation--

                              1+8/3 (1.339 LV)2
             f(V) = s2L/(Pi)  --------------------
                              [1+(1.339 LV)2]11/6

where:
f=power-spectral density (ft./sec.) 2/rad./ft.
s=root-mean-square gust velocity, ft./sec.
V=reduced frequency, radians per foot.
L=2,500 ft.

(3) The limit loads must be obtained by multiplying the A values determined
by the dynamic analysis by the following values of the gust velocity
U<sigma>:
(i) At speed Vc: U<sigma>=85 fps true gust velocity in the interval 0 to
30,000 ft. altitude and is linearly decreased to 30 fps true gust velocity at
80,000 ft. altitude. Where the Administrator finds that a design is
comparable to a similar design with extensive satisfactory service
experience, it will be acceptable to select U<sigma> at Vc less than 85 fps,
but not less than 75 fps, with linear decrease from that value at 20,000 feet
to 30 fps at 80,000 feet. The following factors will be taken into account
when assessing comparability to a similar design:
(1) The transfer function of the new design should exhibit no unusual
characteristics as compared to the similar design which will significantly
affect response to turbulence; e.g., coalescence of modal response in the
frequency regime which can result in a significant increase of loads.
(2) The typical mission of the new airplane is substantially equivalent to
that of the similar design.
(3) The similar design should demonstrate the adequacy of the U<sigma>
selected.
(ii) At speed VB: U<sigma> is equal to 1.32 times the values obtained under
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this appendix.
(iii) At speed VD: U<sigma> is equal to 1/2  the values obtained under
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this appendix.
(iv) At speeds between VB and Vc and between Vc and VD: U<sigma> is equal
to a value obtained by linear interpolation.
(4) When a stability augmentation system is included in the analysis, the
effect of system nonlinearities on loads at the limit load level must be
realistically or conservatively accounted for.
(c) Mission analysis. Limit loads must be determined in accordance with the
following:
(1) The expected utilization of the airplane must be represented by one or
more flight profiles in which the load distribution and the variation with
time of speed, altitude, gross weight, and center of gravity position are
defined. These profiles must be divided into mission segments or blocks, for
analysis, and average or effective values of the pertinent parameters defined
for each segment.
(2) For each of the mission segments defined under paragraph (c)(1) of this
appendix, values of A and No must be determined by analysis. A is defined as
the ratio of root-mean-square incremental load to root-mean-square gust
velocity and No is the radius of gyration of the load power spectral density
function about zero frequency. The power spectral density of the atmospheric
turbulence must be given by the equation set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of
this appendix.
(3) For each of the load and stress quantities selected, the frequency of
exceedance must be determined as a function of load level by means of the
equation--

                         |Y-Yone=g|
N(y) = SUM tNo [ P1 exp ( - ---------------------)
b1A

                               |Y-Yone=g|
                  + P2 exp (- ------------)]
                                 b2A

where--

t=selected time interval.
y=net value of the load or stress.
Yone=g=value of the load or stress in one-g level flight.
N(y)=average number of exceedances of the indicated value of the load or
stress in unit time.
SUM =symbol denoting summation over all mission segments.
No, A=parameters determined by dynamic analysis as defined in paragraph
(c)(2) of this appendix.
P1, P2, b1, b2=parameters defining the probability distributions of root-
mean-square gust velocity, to be read from Figures 1 and 2 of this
appendix.

The limit gust loads must be read from the frequency of exceedance curves at
a frequency of exceedance of 2x10-5 exceedances per hour. Both positive and
negative load directions must be considered in determining the limit loads.
(4) If a stability augmentation system is utilized to reduce the gust
loads, consideration must be given to the fraction of flight time that the
system may be inoperative. The flight profiles of paragraph (c)(1) of this
appendix must include flight with the system inoperative for this fraction of
the flight time. When a stability augmentation system is included in the
analysis, the effect of system nonlinearities on loads at the limit load
level must be conservatively accounted for.
(d) Supplementary design envelope analysis. In addition to the limit loads
defined by paragraph (c) of this appendix, limit loads must also be
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this appendix, except that--
(1) In paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this appendix, the value of U<sigma>=85 fps
true gust velocity is replaced by U<sigma>=60 fps true gust velocity on the
interval 0 to 30,000 ft. altitude, and is linearly decreased to 25 fps true
gust velocity at 80,000 ft. altitude; and
(2) In paragraph (b) of this appendix, the reference to paragraphs
(b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iii) of this appendix is to be understood as
referring to the paragraph as modified by paragraph (d)(1).

Appendix I to Part 25--Installation of an Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control
System (ATTCS)

                       I25.1  General.

(a) This appendix specifies additional requirements for installation of an
engine power control system that automatically resets thrust or power on
operating engine(s) in the event of any one engine failure during takeoff.
(b) With the ATTCS and associated systems functioning normally as designed,
all applicable requirements of Part 25, except as provided in this appendix,
must be met without requiring any action by the crew to increase thrust or
power.

                     I25.2  Definitions.

(a) Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System (ATTCS). An ATTCS is defined as
the entire automatic system used on takeoff, including all devices, both
mechanical and electrical, that sense engine failure, transmit signals,
actuate fuel controls or power levers or increase engine power by other means
on operating engines to achieve scheduled thrust or power increases, and
furnish cockpit information on system operation.
(b) Critical Time Interval. When conducting an ATTCS takeoff, the critical
time interval is between V1 minus 1 second and a point on the minimum
performance, all-engine flight path where, assuming a simultaneous occurrence
of an engine and ATTCS failure, the resulting minimum flight path thereafter
intersects the Part 25 required actual flight path at no less than 400 feet
above the takeoff surface. This time interval is shown in the following

   I25.3  Performance and System Reliability Requirements.

The applicant must comply with the performance and ATTCS reliability
requirements as follows:
(a) An ATTCS failure or a combination of failures in the ATTCS during the
critical time interval:
(1) Shall not prevent the insertion of the maximum approved takeoff thrust
or power, or must be shown to be an improbable event.
(2) Shall not result in a significant loss or reduction in thrust or power,
or must be shown to be an extremely improbable event.
(b) The concurrent existence of an ATTCS failure and an engine failure
during the critical time interval must be shown to be extremely improbable.
(c) All applicable performance requirements of Part 25 must be met with an
engine failure occurring at the most critical point during takeoff with the
ATTCS system functioning.

                   I25.4  Thrust Setting.

The initial takeoff thrust or power setting on each engine at the
beginning of the takeoff roll may not be less than any of the following:
(a) Ninety (90) percent of the thrust or power set by the ATTCS (the
maximum takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane under existing
ambient conditions);
(b) That required to permit normal operation of all safety-related systems
and equipment dependent upon engine thrust or power lever position; or
(c) That shown to be free of hazardous engine response characteristics when
thrust or power is advanced from the initial takeoff thrust or power to the
maximum approved takeoff thrust or power.

                 I25.5  Powerplant Controls.

(a) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 25.1141, no single failure or
malfunction, or probable combination thereof, of the ATTCS, including
associated systems, may cause the failure of any powerplant function
necessary for safety.
(b) The ATTCS must be designed to:
(1) Apply thrust or power on the operating engine(s), following any one
engine failure during takeoff, to achieve the maximum approved takeoff thrust
or power without exceeding engine operating limits;
(2) Permit manual decrease or increase in thrust or power up to the maximum
takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane under existing conditions
through the use of the power lever. For airplanes equipped with limiters that
automatically prevent engine operating limits from being exceeded under
existing ambient conditions, other means may be used to increase the thrust
or power in the event of an ATTCS failure provided the means is located on or
forward of the power levers; is easily identified and operated under all
operating conditions by a single action of either pilot with the hand that is
normally used to actuate the power levers; and meets the requirements of Sec.
25.777 (a), (b), and (c);
(3) Provide a means to verify to the flightcrew before takeoff that the
ATTCS is in a condition to operate; and
(4) Provide a means for the flightcrew to deactivate the automatic
function. This means must be designed to prevent inadvertent deactivation.

               I25.6  Powerplant Instruments.

In addition to the requirements of Sec. 25.1305:
(a) A means must be provided to indicate when the ATTCS is in the armed or
ready condition; and
(b) If the inherent flight characteristics of the airplane do not provide
adequate warning that an engine has failed, a warning system that is
independent of the ATTCS must be provided to give the pilot a clear warning
of any engine failure during takeoff.

     Appendix J to Part 25--Emergency Demonstration

The following test criteria and procedures must be used for showing
compliance with Sec. 25.803:
(a) The emergency evacuation must be conducted either during the dark of
the night or during daylight with the dark of night simulated. If the
demonstration is conducted indoors during daylight hours, it must be
conducted with each window covered and each door closed to minimize the
daylight effect. Illumination on the floor or ground may be used, but it must
be kept low and shielded against shining into the airplane's windows or
doors.
(b) The airplane must be in a normal attitude with landing gear extended.
(c) Unless the airplane is equipped with an off-wing descent means, stands
or ramps may be used for descent from the wing to the ground. Safety
equipment such as mats or inverted life rafts may be placed on the floor or
ground to protect participants. No other equipment that is not part of the
emergency evacuation equipment of the airplane may be used to aid the
participants in reaching the ground.
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this Appendix, only the
airplane's emergency lighting system may provide illumination.
(e) All emergency equipment required for the planned operation of the
airplane must be installed.
(f) Each external door and exit, and each internal door or curtain, must be
in the takeoff configuration.
(g) Each crewmember must be seated in the normally assigned seat for
takeoff and must remain in the seat until receiving the signal for
commencement of the demonstration. Each crewmember must be a person having
knowledge of the operation of exits and emergency equipment and, if
compliance with Sec. 121.291 is also being demonstrated, each flight
attendant must be a member of a regularly scheduled line crew.
(h) A representative passenger load of persons in normal health must be
used as follows:
(1) At least 40 percent of the passenger load must be female.
(2) At least 35 percent of the passenger load must be over 50 years of age.
(3) At least 15 percent of the passenger load must be female and over 50
years of age.
(4) Three life-size dolls, not included as part of the total passenger
load, must be carried by passengers to simulate live infants 2 years old or
younger.
(5) Crewmembers, mechanics, and training personnel, who maintain or operate
the airplane in the normal course of their duties, may not be used as
passengers.
(i) No passenger may be assigned a specific seat except as the
Administrator may require. Except as required by subparagraph (g) of this
paragraph, no employee of the applicant may be seated next to an emergency
exit.
(j) Seat belts and shoulder harnesses (as required) must be fastened.
(k) Before the start of the demonstration, approximately one-half of the
total average amount of carry-on baggage, blankets, pillows, and other
similar articles must be distributed at several locations in aisles and
emergency exit access ways to create minor obstructions.
(l) No prior indication may be given to any crewmember or passenger of the
particular exits to be used in the demonstration.
(m) The applicant may not practice, rehearse, or describe the demonstration
for the participants nor may any participant have taken part in this type of
demonstration within the preceding 6 months.
(n) The pretakeoff passenger briefing required by Sec. 121.571 may be
given. The passengers may also be advised to follow directions of crewmembers
but not be instructed on the procedures to be followed in the demonstration.
(o) If safety equipment as allowed by paragraph (c) of this appendix is
provided, either all passenger and cockpit windows must be blacked out or all
of the emergency exits must have safety equipment in order to prevent
disclosure of the available emergency exits.
(p) Not more than 50 percent of the emergency exits in the sides of the
fuselage of an airplane that meets all of the requirements applicable to the
required emergency exits for that airplane may be used for the demonstration.
Exits that are not to be used in the demonstration must have the exit handle
deactivated or must be indicated by red lights, red tape, or other acceptable
means placed outside the exits to indicate fire or other reason why they are
unusable. The exits to be used must be representative of all of the emergency
exits on the airplane and must be designated by the applicant, subject to
approval by the Administrator. At least one floor level exit must be used.
(q) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, all evacuees must
leave the airplane by a means provided as part of the airplane's equipment.
(r) The applicant's approved procedures must be fully utilized, except the
flightcrew must take no active role in assisting others inside the cabin
during the demonstration.
(s) The evacuation time period is completed when the last occupant has
evacuated the airplane and is on the ground. Provided that the acceptance
rate of the stand or ramp is no greater than the acceptance rate of the means
available on the airplane for descent from the wing during an actual crash
situation, evacuees using stands or ramps allowed by paragraph (c) of this
Appendix are considered to be on the ground when they are on the stand or
ramp.
