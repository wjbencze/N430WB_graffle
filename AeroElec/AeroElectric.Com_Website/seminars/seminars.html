<h4>Folks have asked how we select program sites. The majority of our programs are
offered at the invitation of individuals or EAA chapters who believe there is
sufficient interest to support a seminar in their neighborhood. We're pleased
to offer this program anywhere we 20-25 individuals wish to attend. You tell us . . . <p></h4></center>

In 2008 we gave up a venerable collection of overhead projector
slides and changed to a Power Point presentation enhanced by a
digital sketch pad, and extensive photographic capabilities.
Attendees will take home electronic copies of the presentation
materials. In addition to the reference value of the PP files,
we'll encourage attendees use the materials to support any
presentations they might choose offer to their fellow builders.<p>

In the writer's not so humble opinion, the future of personally owned, single-engine
airplanes is deeply rooted in owner-built and maintained aviation.  The certified
general aviation fleet is DROPPING by thousands of airplanes per year. There's no
indications that production lines will ever again run at the heady rates of yesteryear
when over 10,000 airplanes were produced every year in Wichita alone.  Certified
aviation is unlikely replace more than a fraction of these losses.  If you want performance in a small 
aircraft, it cannot be purchased at prices you and I can afford. The alternative is 
obvious - build it. . . . <p>

Aircraft fabrication was once a "black art" practiced only by the heavily 
regulated, taxpayer subsidized aircraft industry.  Today ordinary citizens 
have access to technologies and materials only the military and NASA could 
afford 25 years ago. A visit to Oshkosh any summer demonstrates how personal 
initiative and ingenuity has left institutionalized aviation in the dust.  The 
AeroElectric Connection offers this course to broaden the technology base in 
support of builders who dare to dream of flying their own handiwork.<p>

Some of the world's finest airplanes are being built in basements and garages. 
Although the vast majority of participants in the OBAM aircraft community are
amateurs, they worry about EVERYTHING. If you don't know how to go about it,
you'll get on the 'net and find help. If you trash a part, it gets pulled
off and replaced. The craftsmanship that goes into a successfully completed
OBAM aircraft is on a par with and often head-and-shoulders above that of
the spam cans.<P>

<h3>Designing for Failure Tolerance:</h3><p>

Many builders purchase "aircraft quality" or "military spec" parts 
suffering from the  mistaken idea that use of such parts increases system 
reliability; <b>this is simply not so.</b> <p>

Our task  is to teach you how to fabricate  reliable FLIGHT SYSTEMS 
using ordinary parts chosen for  price and performance features . . . NOT 
simply for their specifications.   System reliability is driven more by HOW 
parts are used as opposed to WHAT parts are used.<p>

Each attendee will receive a CD Rom with all of the downloadable 
articles and wirebooks from this website. The CD also contains copies of
the Power Point files that Bob will use in the presentation.<p>

This seminar is designed to mitigate one more batch of worries. 
We can't make an engineer of you in a weekend. Two things should happen: (1) you're
going to be a lot more comfortable with starting - it's just a big box of simple-pieces 
and (2) as your project progresses, you're now networked with myself and hundreds
of others who will help with solutions to new worries in any manner that we can.<p>

Before you purchase any electrical system parts or drill any holes 
in the panel, look this website over closely and check out the 
<A> <A HREF="http://aeroelectric.com/articles.html"> reference materials. </A>  
If at all possible, join us for a weekend of discussions to get your questions answered.<p>

<li>There is a great deal of advance planning associated with organizing 
this program. We need to reserve a facility big enough to handle everyone 
we think will attend. A minimum number of attendees are necessary to offset 
travel and facilities expenses. Seating will be limited. <p>

</ul>
<h3>Tuition: $185.00</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>The AeroElectric Connection is the textbook for this course. If don't
own a copy, you may secure a E-Book copy of the latest revision at the seminar for
a special discounted price of $21.50 postage paid. Receive your book in advance
of the seminar by adding a request for immediate mailing in the comments box of
the reservation form . . .<p>

<li>All products and 
services from the AeroElectric Connection are offered with an assurance 
of satisfaction. If you don't believe the seminar was worth the dollars

<h3>If you'd like to see a program presented in your part of the country, <A HREF=http://www.aeroelectric.com/bob.nuckolls>Click here to contact Bob at AeroElectric Connection</a> and let's talk about it. It would help if you have a facility in mind  . . . it's nice when we can use an aviation related facility. Does your EAA chapter has a room where we can seat up to 30 folks at tables . . . or perhaps an FBO near you has a meeting room on the airport?  In any case, it won't happen until rattle our cage and get the ball rolling . . .</h3></td>
