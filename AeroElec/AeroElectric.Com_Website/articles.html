<FONT SIZE=4>Unlike closely held inventions and processes unique to individuals, knowledge and
understanding are commodities that GROW in value the more they are shared. While
the techniques and style of sharing may vary from teacher to teacher, the fundamentals
are pre-existing and without ownership. If anyone finds an opportunity to expand 
the universe of dissemination for ideas offered on this website, you are free to reprint
any materials published here. All I would ask is that reprints be published without 
modification and properly cited as to source.<P>

If anyone detects a variance from facts or physics in any materials published on
this website, I'd certainly like to hear from you. These pages are not intended
to be the gospel according to Bob Nuckolls but a repository for some of the best
aircraft design, fabrication and operating techniques to be found anywhere.  Words
found on these pages are representative of many sources of information not the least
of which include our readers. Comments and alternative views from anyone are always
welcome.<p>
