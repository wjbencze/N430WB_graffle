      And then everything went quiet.............

</p>


<p>

The Oshkosh air show had just concluded and Jenny &amp; I packed the Europa up for the first leg of our planned trip
to Calgary in Canada.  Our first stop was going to be North West of Minneapolis.  I had been watching the weather
closely and although it was not optimal, it looked pretty good for a day of VFR cruising.

I picked up my final briefing and headed out the airport early in the afternoon.  After packing the aircraft and doing
my last checks we taxied out and got underway.&nbsp;

</p>

<p>  About an hour into the journey the weather didn't quite appear as
advertised.&nbsp; The sky in the NWW quadrant was looking darker than expected
and there was a lot more&nbsp;&nbsp;haze than expected.&nbsp; After about 15
more minutes I decided that it was time to call for an updated weather
report.&nbsp; I dialed up the Flight Service frequency and waited while they
were talking with another aircraft.&nbsp; While I was waiting I noticed a short
streak of cloud to cloud lightning about 10 miles of my port wing.&nbsp; I immediately
turned away from the area and headed for clear blue sky out to my
starboard.&nbsp; I headed away from&nbsp; the area of about 5 minutes and
then....... <b><i>everything went quiet </i></b>...

</p>

<br>


It all seemed to happen at once, but in slow motion.&nbsp; I heard a crackle on
the radio and then I saw a long white streak on the starboard wingtip stretching out
into the distance.&nbsp; I have a shut off knob on the tunnel for the air box
which supplies ventilation for the cabin and my knee was leaning up against
it.&nbsp; I guess there is about 4 feet of cable, but it was enough to induce a
significant voltage to electrocute me.&nbsp; That the same time a shower of
sparks erupted from the metal ring on the window shade that was attached with
suction cups.<p>The
panel went blank, and apart from the engine running things were
quite.&nbsp; I looked out at both wings and saw long black training
streaks on the tips.&nbsp; My first reaction was to check my 4 axis of
control to ensure the
aircraft was still flyable, which is was.&nbsp; I then surveyed the
exterior for
any other signs of damage, and none was evident. My next concern was
electric
fuel pumps continuing to run. I have my aircraft wired up with an
E-Buss setup
as&nbsp; described by Bob Knuckles of Aero Electric.&nbsp; In addition,
one fuel
pump is connected directly the to alternator so&nbsp; I turned on the
E-Buss and
GPS / Radio along with the transponder sprang into life but nothing
much
else.&nbsp; I press the "Nearest" function but the GPS seemed pretty
confused so I dug out my hand held.&nbsp; As luck would have it I was
only a few
miles away from an airport and with over 8000' beneath me I knew I even
with the
engine out I was fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The airfield was un attended and taxied up the the office and shut the
aircraft down.&nbsp; We both got out and needless to say were pretty shaken by
the experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I secured the aircraft and called it a day as I was pretty well done with
flying for a while.&nbsp; A couple of hours later an enormous thunderstorm
rolled through, and&nbsp; looking on the weather radar is it appeared to cover most
of the state.&nbsp; I called the weather briefer at the Flight Service Station
and he told me that they had got it wrong, and the weather pattern was
completely unexpected..</p>

<p>The next day I unpacked the aircraft and started to survey the damage.&nbsp;
The first thing I looked for was welding&nbsp; of the control mechanisms and I
couldn't see any evidence of this.&nbsp; I pulled off the tip lights and looked
inside the wings and I could not see any internal damage, nor was any evident in
the inspection ports.&nbsp; It appeared that the conduction path was only along
the navigation lights wiring.&nbsp; Surprisingly the wires seemed intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next problem was that the main contactor would not energize.&nbsp; As
part of reducing the system load I had used a Kilovolt contactor which had a
circuit on it to reduce the hold in current.&nbsp; The fuse to the contactor had
vaporized, however when I replaced it the contactor still wouldn't energize, so
I bridged it out with a solid jumper cable and started the engine.</p>

<p>At this point I had what appeared to be a structurally intact aircraft and a
running motor so the last thing to check was the radio.&nbsp; I had a hand held
and did a transmit test of the main radio and I was amazed to see that it worked.&nbsp; As it
turned out the GX60, SL70 and the EIS Engine monitor were the only pieces of
electronics on the aircraft that survived.</p>

<p>The 70 minute trip home was pretty uneventful and I put the aircraft in the
hanger and left it.&nbsp; To be honest I was pretty hacked off, and I shouldn't
be, I should have been thankful that we weren't killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

   <span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Surveying the damage</span></b>
</p>

<p>
I dragged the Comanche out and took a break over in Kentucky.&nbsp; It had been
a while since I had flown the Comanche and had forgotten what a nice flying
aircraft it is.&nbsp; The old joke of, if you want a good two place aircraft then
buy a 4 place aircraft is pretty true.&nbsp; The first weekend after my return I
started checking things out and here is what I found no longer worked.

</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navaids TC / Autopilot

</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navaids Servo

</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intercom

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Panel dimmer

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuel gauge

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main contactor

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wing tip lights

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tail light

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Narco 122 VOR / Localizer / Glideslope / Marker beacon

</p>

<p><b>Navaids</b>

</p>

<p>Both the servo and head were taken out.&nbsp; I took the cover off and the
tracks were missing off the board so I figured it was a basket case and I sent
it back to the factory.

</p>

<p><b>Intercom.</b>

</p>

<p>
   The Intercom&nbsp;was a panel mount unit from XCOM and it seemed okay at
 first, but every now and then the transmitter would behave like it had a stuck
 mike.&nbsp; At first I suspected the mike switch on the control column, but
 after a slow process of elimination I began to suspect the intercom.&nbsp; I
 replaced the unit and the fault didn't reappear.
</p>

<p><b>Fuel gauge</b>

</p>

<p>I have a fuel gauge system designed by Tony Krzyzewski.&nbsp; It has a zero
to one inch pressure transducer at the lowest point in the tank and it sends via
a microprocessor a signal to a panel display.&nbsp; I expected that the
microprocessors had failed, how ever it turned out that one of the 4 RS232
drivers on the MAX232 had failed.&nbsp; Why one and not the others I don't know,
but it sure made fault diagnosis difficult.

</p>

<p>
<b>Panel dimmer</b>

</p>

<p>The panel dimmer is one Bob Knuckles designs sold by B&amp;C.&nbsp; I decided
for 30 bucks I wasn't going to mess with it, but as it turned out I wish I
had.&nbsp; The new one had a different pin out and the wiring loom was pretty
embedded so I ended up replacing the parts and burnt off tracks.

</p>

<p>
<b>Main contactor</b>

</p>


<p>The main contactor was beyond repair so I replaced it with a prototype solid
state unit&nbsp; from Eric Jones of <a href="http://www.periheliondesign.com/">http://www.periheliondesign.com/</a>
It also will be susceptible to large voltage spikes, but I am hoping that I won't get
hit by lighting again.&nbsp; You can see in the photograph where the parts had
vaporized and left burn marks on the casing.</p>

<p><b>Wing tip lights</b></p>
<p>The wing tip lights are also made by Eric Jones of <a href="http://www.periheliondesign.com/">http://www.periheliondesign.com</a>.
They were pretty vaporized so I bought some new ones.&nbsp; Quite a bit of
the metal was deposited on the inside of the wing tip lens covers and I had to
sand it off with wet and dry and re polish then with Mico Mesh.</p>


<p>The tail light LED was taken out as well, interestingly enough the 700 ma
semiconductor current limit survived just fine, but on Eric's advice I replaced
it as well.</p>

<p><b>Narco 122 VOR / Localizer / Glideslope / Marker beacon</b></p>
<p>Interestingly enough this wasn't even turned on but it didn't matter.&nbsp; I
was very fortunate to have Fred Fillenger volunteer to take a look at it.&nbsp;
Apparently it was pretty sad inside so we bought a second non working unit on
Ebay and Fred made one good one from both.&nbsp; It actually came back working
better than before.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
  <b><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">So, where did the lightning go....</span></b>
</p>

<p>Its hard to be sure, but it looks like the lightning entered the starboard
wing and exited the port side.&nbsp; The strangest thing about this was that on
the starboard side I had clear blue sky as far as I could see, and on the port
side any evidence of storm activity was 20 miles way.&nbsp; At no time did I see
any typical thunder clouds forming and the main storm front didn't pass through
for three more hours.&nbsp; It had tracked through the wing tip wiring, though
the panel and out the other side.&nbsp; I have a single potentiometer that both
dims the lights and turns on a relay to turn on the nav lights.&nbsp; The
lightning jumped the relay and though the dimmer board.&nbsp; From there it
tracked in to the VOR light circuit and I think down the left / right signal
into the Navaids. The intercom is connected to the Navaids to disable it when
the PTT button is pressed, so I can only assume that how it got into the XCOM.&nbsp;
As for the main contactor, your guess is as good as mine, but a few milliseconds
of lightning can sure go a long way.
</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Lessons learned</b></p>

<p>Well a few things I guess.&nbsp; A weather forecast 2 hours old might as well
be 100 years old.&nbsp; If I called on departure I might of been warned.&nbsp;
Secondly,&nbsp; it was obvious that the weather wasn't as advertised and I
should had reacted to my instinct much sooner.&nbsp; I wasted 15 minutes being
in denial.&nbsp; Lastly, I don't know it if would have helped, but I normally
file IFR for long cross country legs and although Centers job isn't run weather
for you I have had them warn me in the past of unexpected activity.</p>

<p>N378PJ took about 5 weekends worth of work to get it flying again, and it
wasn't back to a state of full repair for a couple of months.&nbsp; With a
little bit of help from my friends it was all fixed for about $1200.</p>
