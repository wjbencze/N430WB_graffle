When space and/or weight-and-balance considerations for your airplane call for
mounting one or more batteries remote from engine instead of on the firewall, you not only
have to provide conductors for carrying the hot (+) terminals of the battery(ies)
forward, the negative (-) terminals need to find your electrical system ground
as well.<p>

Since day-one, aircraft with electrical systems have (like automobiles) used
the vehicle's metallic structure as a ground return for many electrical system
components including the battery. From the perspective of gross functionality
this technique has worked well. But, since we in the OBAM aircraft world are both
more sensitive to (and able to adjust designs for optimum performance with respect
to noise or cost of ownership issues that arise later for having to find and
fix 'fuzzy' ground joints), there is value in considering exactly which
devices might share a common airframe ground without risk of increased noise.

<a href= http://aeroelectric.com/whatsnew.html>The latest revision to Appendix Z, 
Figure 15, View-A</a> depicts the electrically "pure" ground system for any position of the battery(ies)
in the airplane. Ideally, one would like to use none of the airplane's structure
as part of the electrical system . . . especially the engine mount.<p>

Having said that, a time proven compromise that does not materially affect noise
issues is to use the airframe as ground for the following items:<p>
<ul>

<li>Battery<p>

<li>Strobe supply<p>
  
<li>Landing, nav and taxi lights<p>

<li>Pitot heat<p>

<li>Hydraulic pumps for gear<p>
</ul>

While some of these are strong antagonists or sympathetic antagonists (due to
their high current draw), remote grounding to airframe does not represent a
threat to potential victims as long as victim grounding remains true to the single point
ground philosophy: Sensitive accessories get a SINGLE quality ground not shared
with any potential antagonists.

The photo above is a exemplar dual battery installation in the tail of an all metal
airplane.<p>

The only things I would do differently in this installation is to make the battery
ground tab from a piece of extruded aluminum angle with a 1/8" or so web thickness.
The bent-metal tab with fat wires bolted to it represents a small failure risk at the
bend due to vibration. In this particular case, both batteries ground to the same
tab and failure of the tab would cause loss of both batteries.<P>

Second, TWO robust tabs, one for each battery is a better way to go.<p>

Fly comfortably.<p>
