    <td><b>High quality permanent splices applied with crimp tools can add considerable
	bulk to a multi-wire bundle. Modern crimp splices for aircraft are now available
	with very small diameters and volumes . . . but the individual splices and
	tools for installation are not cheap. Consider this technique which offers the
	same integrity and space savings with a little more effort and a lot less cost.<p>

	Here's a lap-soldered joint next to a d-sub pins joint. If you anticipate
	a future need to open the joint for maintenance,  D-sub pins under
	heat-shrink are an ideal substitute for the more classic knife splices
	in small wires. If the joint is permanent, may I suggest that the
	soldered lap joint is preferred and costs less.<p>
	
	Of course, if soldering is inconvenient or not possible, D-sub pins
	under heatshrink is a perfectly acceptable addition to your bag of
	tricks for quality splicing of small wires.</b>
