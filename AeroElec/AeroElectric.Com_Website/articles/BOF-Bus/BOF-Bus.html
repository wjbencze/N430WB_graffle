<b><i>Comments/Questions: I am building a Jabiru J430 and plan to include your
crowbar over-voltage system and low voltage detector. I am planning on a
dual battery where the second battery supports the main bus but not the
starter motor. The plan is to put a power diode between the bus and the
main battery. This means that that both batteries will charge from the
regulator but the second battery will not contribute to starting and provide
a sink to the bus to ensure voltage is maintained to the bus even during
starting. The idea is for the second battery to keep the electrics going in
the event of main battery failure. Do you think this make sense?</b></i><p>

There are two separate issues here: First, If you have electronics that are
NOT designed to live in the real world of KNOWN brownouts that exist in aircraft,
then having a special battery to support those items during cranking may be
necessary. This assumes it's unacceptable to delay turning these devices on
until after the engine is started. Further, we'll address the question of
"battery failures". The goal of this deliberation is to see how much weight and cost
of ownership we can carve out of the system you've proposed . . .<p>

Dual batteries add weight, complexity and cost of ownership. If your selection
of accessories makes a second battery an operational necessity, then you also
need to craft brown-out free bus (BOF-Bus). A battery sized to support only
devices connected to a BOF-Bus can be small . . . say a 2AH device weighing a
couple of pounds. It would also be pretty neat if we make the presence of a BOF-Bus
transparent to normal operations of the airplane.<p>

See drawing at the end of this article that describes the minimum weight, minimum
cost implementation of a BOF-Bus. I show a BOF-Bus combined with the E-Bus.
Any of devices not necessary during battery-only, endurance-assured flight would
want to have their own ON/OFF switches. This would permit shedding these loads
during PLAN-B operations which I'll describe later.  The wiring is just like any
other Z-figure for E-Bus except for items added in red to make it a BOF-Bus too.
There's a two-pole relay in the starter push-button circuit that ties the BOF
battery to the BOF-Bus milliseconds before the starter is engaged through the same
relay. This insures that the E/BOF-Bus is supported for tens of milliseconds that
Main Bus voltage is depressed due to starter motor inrush current.<p>

A second relay charges the BOF Battery via connection from the Main Battery
Bus but only after the main battery rises above 13.0 volts. The elevated voltage
indicates that an alternator is now operational, ready to run ship's electro-whizzies
and charge both batteries. The exclusive purpose of this itty-bitty battery
is to mitigate the brown-out problems with the lightest practical device capable
of supporting BOF-Bus loads for mere seconds. Therefore, provisions for loading
this battery in flight are not provided.<p>

The BOF system could be installed with a weight penalty of less than 3 pounds. However,
adding a second battery to your airplane JUST to guard against failure of the Main
Battery has high $weight$ and $ownership$ numbers. A second battery large enough
to stand in for a "failed" main battery needs to be the same size . . . 15 pounds
or more? Let us consider the idea of "battery failure".<p> 

Unless you're planning NOT to maintain your battery, then gross battery failure is
exceedingly remote. A battery can and should be the most reliable source of power
in the airplane. It DOES demand a rational preventative maintenance program to
gage the battery's present CAPACITY against your ENDURANCE requirements. Batteries DO demand consideration for how they're installed. Don't bolt STIFF
wires to lead posts, don't expose to radiation from exhaust stacks, take reasonable
precautions against out-of-tolerance voltages for charging, etc.<p>

Since you've expressed a concern for keeping certain electro-whizzies operating
under battery-only operations, one must first consider (1) WHICH devices are the
most useful for the purpose of getting destination airport in sight, how much (2)
CURRENT these devices and (3) for HOW LONG? After you've deduced these answers, what
is your PLAN-B for making sure that the battery in your airplane is up to the
task? <p>

If you choose not to craft a preventative maintenance program to assure compliance
with your PLAN-B design goals, then it matters not how many batteries you install
or how you wire them. The fact that you can get the engine started is the least
important feature of your battery system that needs monitoring. It's my considered
recommendation that your design goals far exceed the FAA's favorite 30 minute
endurance rule for battery only operations. In my mind, having a light come on
telling you that the panel will go dark in 30 minutes IS an emergency.<p>

<table width=100%><tr><td>
<font size=4>There are two qualifying tests of a battery. LOAD TESTING proves the battery's
ability to carry high loads such as starting the engine. This is the test a service
station operator puts on your car battery using a device similar to this one. 
Passing this test simply says the battery will deliver sufficient POWER and cranking
currents (200A or more) through a sufficiently LOW INTERNAL RESISTANCE to start
the engine . . . a relatively low-energy event that needs perhaps 5% of the battery's
capacity. </font></td><td><Img width=400 src=HF91129_4.jpg></td></tr></table>

<table width=100%><tr><td><image width=400 src=9044-100-1.jpg></td><td>
<font size=4>CAPACITY testing measures the battery's total energy delivered under
protocols defined by (1), (2) and (3)above.  The 'Connection will offer a means
for minimum $time$, in-situ battery capacity testing as a 3-ounce accessory to be
installed in an aircraft. The Product Function Specification has been submitted to
my software guru. He's going to teach an 80-cent processor how to do this job while
you're home mowing the lawn, hangar flying over a suds or attending some other
task more worthwhile than praying over your ship's year-old battery.</font></td></tr></table>
<p>

My personal design philosophy strives to never experience an electrically induced
emergency. PLAN-B and in some cases PLAN-C will be in place to deal with an
alternator-out situation in an orderly, no-sweat manner. This requires crafting
maintenance and operating protocols for ownership that meet my design goals
throughout the lifetime of the airplane. The protocols call out -either- 
PERIODIC REPLACEMENT of what appears to be a perfectly good battery because it's
still cranking the engine -or- CAPACITY TESTING against your personalized design
goals defined by (1), (2) and (3) above. You didn't mention whether or not you
plan to have a vacuum system. If you're going all-electric, then Figure Z-13/8
in the 'Connection would offer yet another layer of system reliability and
expanded endurance with a minimum of added weight and cost of ownership.<p>

If you subscribe to the "no electrical emergencies" design goal, you need decide
which protocol offers the lowest cost of ownership:(A) throw a new $50 battery in
every annual or (B) acquire the $tools$ and spend the $time$ to track your
battery's condition or (C) adding the second, engine driven power source (like
that shown in Z-13/8) that lets you run a battery until it simply won't crank the
engine any more.<p>

99.9% of battery failures are NOT because the battery went "bad". Most unplanned
replacements occur because a battery was either by poor attention to
operating conditions and/or left in service long past its ability to perform to
design goals. The path to airborne bliss is NOT stacking in more batteries with
the HOPE that at least one of them will get you home. Battery Nirvana comes from
CONFIDENCE in your battery's ability to do the job you've assigned it with a minimum
weight, system complexity and cost of ownership. The solution for both confident
battery only operations AND crafting a brown-out free bus doesn't need to be
heavy, complex or expensive.<p>

Fly comfortably.<p>
