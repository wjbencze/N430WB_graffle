Tool catalogs and the shelves of tool stores are replete with examples of
what tool designers hope are the greatest wire strippers ever invented. The
purpose of this piece is not to praise or disparage any particular tool or
technique. My intent is to study and illustrate the physics of wire
stripping. Armed with understanding, you're better prepared to evaluate
any wire stripping tool and decide for your self if the tool's cost/benefit
ratio is worthy of your time and dollars.<p>

The tool shown here is a very accurate clone of a design that has been around
for at least 40 years. This model is sold by Radio Shack and costs about $12. Dozens
if not hundreds of companies make similar tools. These are intended to close
precision knife-edged hole over a conductor while simultaneously gripping the
wire immediately behind the blades.

A close up inspection of the stripping dies on this tool shows us a relatively
simple, knife-edged cutter with holes sized to provide clearance around various
wire sizes while the knives are expected to cut the insulation without damaging
underlying wires. Squeezing the handles drives the wire-grip and blades apart . . 
if everything goes well, insulation is neatly removed from the end of the wire.

A sketch of this stripper's cross section illustrates the manner in which
the blades come together. If the wire stranding is oversized or if you use
a "too small" opening to strip the wire, there is possibility of damage to
the conductors.

Here's a close up view of the very same tool as shown above except the wire
stripping dies are designed a bit different. Here, holes in stripping dies
are cylindrical . . .

Furthermore, the "knives" intended to cut the insulation are not even
sharp-edged.  One can see that these dies are more difficult to make than
the knife-edged dies above  . . . but a hundred dollars worth harder?
Yep, that's the approximate difference in cost of a stripper with the so-called
tefzel or teflon dies and the plain vanilla PVC dies shown above. Unfortunately,
these very nice stripping dies come with an equally nice price. Typical pricing
for these tools is in the $140 to $160 range.<p>

Here's a sketch of how the "tef" dies come down on the wire's insulation. Even
if the blades do touch the conductors, there are no sharp edges to damage the
strands. Obviously, there's not much cutting going on either. My grandma used
to harvest the chicken for Sunday dinner by standing on a broomstick placed
across the chicken's neck and pulling on the legs . . . no cutting required. Just
grab it around the spot where you want to create a stress-riser and pull. Off
it comes.

This very low cost wire stripper has been in my toolbox for years. In fact, I carry
one just like it as the ONLY wire stripper in my super-compact set of tools that
I keep in my desk at Raytheon.  The tool was sold to me a long time ago with an
"adjustable stop" screw and nut that rides in the slotted handle. The other two
open holes were where a spring was riveted on .  . . ostensibly to make the tool
easier to use by having it spring open. I've removed both features and don't
miss them. Here's why . . . . <p>

If you consider the design of the high dollar stripping dies in the tool above, we
can deduce that it is not necessary to CUT insulation from the end of a wire. W
When small strands of wire inside are subject to damage by contact with
sharp edges, we can see advantages for not having a sharp-edged tool. 
This low-dollar stripper offers some risk in that
regard. That's why I took the spring and adjustable stop off. Stripping wire is like
flying an airplane - you don't put POSITION commands into the controls . . . when
you're maneuvering an airplane, your perception of control FORCE is more 
precise than control POSITION. With these el-cheapo strippers, I have learned 
to grab the wire's insulation with enough force that the blades get a grip on the wire in at least
4 places around it's circumference.<p>

The right force provides a grip without cutting . . . I need to induce
stress risers in the right places and then pull the insulation off. In fact, this
tool is so old and "dull" at the finished edges of the notch that it's fairly
safe to use around relatively fragile conductors of a 19-strand, 22AWG wire.

On occasion, I've invited the displeasure of various observers by stripping
the end of a wire with this kind of tool. This critter IS sharp . . . it IS
designed to CUT wires but that doesn't mean that you HAVE to cut wires. I have
taught myself to give the insulation a little mash with the sharpened edges and
then rotate the tool 90 degrees. Apply and hold a second mash and then pull. The insulation
comes off with no contact of the blades against wire strands.<p>

<tr><td><a href="5strip.jpg">Click here for larger image.</a> Here's a microphotograph
of the same style of wire stripped with wire cutters using technique cited above. Insulation isn't
cut away as cleanly but it's still quite adequate. Note that there are no nicked or
scraped strands.<p>

At every weekend seminar, I will circulate various crimp tools, terminals and pieces of wire
for attendees to try. I could also supply the high dollar strippers for these hands-on
demonstrations. I believe it's more useful to have students use a pair of flush-cutters
to get a feel for what's necessary to achieve a useful wire stripping action.<p>

I'm not necessarily recommending that you don't invest in a good pair of strippers. The
goal of the demonstration and for this article is to show that it's not necessary. With
a bit of practice one can perhaps expend limited dollars on more useful tools.

This is fun to do in front of some puffed-up inspector-type who is ready
to have me keel-hauled for having damaged a wire that I intend to connect to an
airplane. I invite him to get out his magnifying glass and show me damaged
strands. Admittedly, the END of the INSULATION doesn't come off as cleanly as
with the high-dollar tool but it's not bad either. The slightly ragged insulation
does not interfere with the final installation and in most situations, the rough
end disappears inside the insulation grip of a terminal or inside the back-shell
of a connector and you can't even see it.<p>

If one understands the task there may be a number of ways to skin the proverbial
cat no matter what tools are at hand. All of the tools illustrated above
were found in my various tool boxes. When I'm working at the bench, I make
regular use of both the high-dollar strippers and Radio Shack Stripmaster clones
 - they DO offer a level of convenience and low-effort repeatability. However, there
 are ways to get the job done in a technically sound manner when 
working with tools that come from a little wooden box that fits in a briefcase.<p> 

Bottom line is that you can try out and/or learn to use a variety of stripping
tools and decide which ones best meet your needs, patience and willingness to
acquire some new skills. UNDERSTANDING how it's suppose to work and what the
requirements are for end results will give you a lot of latitude for adopting
various solutions.<p>

Happy stripping . . . <p>
