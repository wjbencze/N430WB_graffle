When wiring panel lighting, a builder may encounter a situation where multiple
panel lamp fixtures need a place to get power.  For example, the 6-pak of
flight instruments may have 12 pairs of power and ground wires for eyebrow,
wedge or post lighting.<p>

Here's a one way to provide a mini-bus structure close by the lighting fixtures
that is neat, compact and easy to fabricate. <a href="minibus1.jpg">Click here for 
larger image.</a>  We start with a D-sub
connector having sufficient number of pins. For example, a 25-pin connector illustrated
here will easily accommodate 12 pairs of both power and ground wires for an
array of lighting circuits. D-subs also come in 9, 15 and 37 pin varieties which
may be more suited to your task. Further, if all you're wiring are post-lights,
these automatically ground to the panel through their mounting post and you don't
need a ground bus.  When picking the connector size, allow for some unused
spare slots for future expansion.<p>

Use a solder-cup, female connector and solder combinations of pins together
to form a mini power distribution bus.  Here I used short pieces of 16AWG
wire with insulation removed. Lay the short wire segments between the pins to
be joined and solder as shown.<p>

Now's the time to add feeders to your mini-busses . . . these wires will
route off to the dimmer control and to airframe ground.

<a href="minibus2.jpg">Click here for larger image</a>  Here you see the bussed
female connector mated with a male housing. I've used threaded spacers to hold
the connectors together and angle brackets to provide a means for mounting the
assembly.<p>

I prefer the machined, crimp-on D-sub pins so by choosing a solder cup female
as the bussing connector, less expensive male pins can be used to terminate
individual fixture wires at your dimmer's mini-bus. <p>

Mount this assembly on the instrument panel in some central 
to the light fixtures being wired up.  If the best mounting
requires holes in the panel and you'd really like to avoid screw-heads
showing on the pilot side of the panel, consider attaching a 1" wide mounting base
of aluminum sheet, say 0.062" thick and then using the surface of this
sheet to mount the assembly to the back of the panel with high-bond
strength, double-sticky, foam tape.
