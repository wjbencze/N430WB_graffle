Ah youth...The older I get, the more I enjoy Saturday mornings.  Perhaps
it's the quiet solitude that comes with being the first to rise, or maybe, it's
the unbounded joy of not having to be at work.  Either way, the first few
hours of a Saturday morning are most enjoyable.<p>

A few weeks ago, I was shuffling toward the kitchen, with a steaming cup of
coffee in one hand and the morning paper in the other.  What began as a
typical Saturday morning turned into one of those lessons that life seems to
hand you from time to time.  Let me tell you about it.<p>

I turned the volume up on my radio in order to listen to a Saturday morning
talk show.  I heard an older sounding chap with  a golden voice.  You know
the kind, he sounded like he should be in the  broadcasting business
himself.  He was talking about "a thousand marbles" to  someone named "Tom".
I was intrigued and sat down to listen to what he had  to say:<p>

<b>"Well, Tom,
it sure sounds like you're busy with your job.  I'm sure they pay you well
but it's a shame you have to be away from home and your family so much.
Hard to believe a young fellow should have to work sixty or seventy hours a week
to make ends meet.  Too bad you missed your daughter's dance recital."  He
continued, "Let me tell you something Tom, something that has helped me keep
a good perspective on my own priorities."  And that's when he began to
explain his theory of a "thousand marbles."<p>

"You see Tom, I sat down one day and did a little arithmetic.  The average
person lives about seventy-five years.  I know, some live more and some live
less, but on average, folks live about seventy-five years." "Now then, I
multiplied 75 times 52 and I came up with 3900 which is the number of
Saturdays that the average person has in their entire lifetime.<p>

"Now stick with me Tom, I'm getting to the important part." "It took me
until I was fifty-five years old to think about all this in any detail", he went
on, "and by that time I had lived through over twenty-eight hundred
Saturdays.<p>

I got to thinking that if I lived to be seventy-five, I only had about a
thousand of them left to enjoy.  "So I went to a toy store and bought every
single marble they had.  I ended up having to visit three toy stores to
round-up 1000 marbles.  I took them home and put them inside of a large,
clear plastic container right here in my workshop next to the radio.<p>

Every Saturday since then, I have taken one marble out and thrown it way.
"I found that by watching the marbles diminish, I focused more on the really
important things in life.  There is nothing like watching your time here on
this earth run out to help get your priorities straight."<p>

"Now let me tell you one last thing before I sign-off with you and take my
lovely wife out for breakfast.  This morning, I took the very last marble
out of the container.  I figure if I make it until next Saturday then God has
blessed me with a little extra time to be with my loved ones......"It was
nice to talk to you Tom, I hope you spend more time with your loved ones,
and I hope to meet you again someday.  Have a good morning!"</b><p>

You could have heard a pin drop when he finished.  Even the show's moderator
didn't have anything to say for a few moments.  I guess he gave us all a lot
to think about.<p>

I had planned to do some work that morning, then go to the gym.  Instead, I
went upstairs and woke my wife up with a kiss.  "C'mon honey, I'm taking you
and the kids to breakfast." "What brought this on?" she asked with a smile.<p>

"Oh, nothing special," I said.  " It's just been a long time since we spent
a Saturday together with the kids.  Hey, can we stop at a toy store while
we're out?  I need to buy some marbles."<p>

HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND AND MAY ALL SATURDAYS BE SPECIAL AND MAY YOU HAVE MANY
HAPPY YEARS...  EVEN AFTER YOUR LAST MARBLE.<p>
