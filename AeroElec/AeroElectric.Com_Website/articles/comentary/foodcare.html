<P>The time has come for the eating public to face a stark 
reality: The consumption of food, if allowed to grow at the present rate, will 
bankrupt North America. In the U.S., production of food has risen from 10% to more 
than 30% of the gross domestic product since 1945. The U.S. Congressional Budget 
Office projects that by the year 2010 Americans will spend more money and time 
on eating than on working, vacationing, and being sick combined. To counter 
this threat, a junior U.S. senator (whose name has been withheld upon request) has 
begun to draft legislation designed to fundamentally reform the way Americans 
consume food. The proposal, preliminarily dubbed "Managed Foodcare," promotes the 
cost-efficient consumption of food by regulating access to stores and restaurants. 
It preserves the principles of consumer choice and free competition.

<P>A brief outline will illustrate how the reforms benefit the average eater. Each year, 
during the last week of December, consumers have the choice of signing up at 
their preferred grocery store or restaurant for the year to come. These two main 
retail markets for the distribution of food are referred to as Primary Food Providers. 
Employers will by law be required to offer employees a choice among at 
least three so-called Food Benefit Plans. FBPs describe what stores, restaurants, 
kinds of food and menus will be covered by the plan. FBPs will also furnish comprehensive 
brochures listing the items approved, such as certain cereals, vegetables, 
meats, and so on.

<P>The lawmakers anticipate that the opportunity to choose 
only once a year what to eat for the next 12 months will save families innumerable 
hours of time now spent on gazing at store shelves or menus and comparing 
brands and prices. During the year of the plan, consumers will be obliged to 
buy all their food at the chosen store and eat at the restaurant they elected. There 
will be a designated copayment, and together with their employer, they will 
also pay a monthly premium to a Food Management Organization.

<P>FMOs, whose formation 
will be encouraged under the legislation, are privately owned corporations. 
They control the production and manage the distribution of food based on a 
highly variable Cost Efficiency Quotient, whose numerical value is directly proportional 
to the value at which the FMOs' stocks are traded on the open market. FMOs 
contract with Primary Food Providers to provide the most cost-efficient nutrition 
to their enrollees.

<P>The key element of the reform is known as "capitation." 
Basically, stores and restaurants will receive a fixed annual amount of money 
from their FMO for each enrolled customer, regardless of how much or little 
he consumes during the year. If the enrollee spends more than his allotment, it 
will be the provider's loss; if less, it will be the provider's gain.

<P>Legislators 
from New York and California have objected that some people habitually eat 
more than others or have developed rather idiosyncratic and expensive tastes. Such 
behavior, comparable to the reckless spending of health dollars by people with 
chronic or terminal illnesses, could quickly bankrupt the provider. To counter 
this fiscal threat, the FMOs will maintain personal customer records listing all 
purchases, creating an "Individual Consumption Profile" (ICP) for each member. 
The ICP is subject to periodic review and approval by the FMO. People with excessive 
ICPs are considered "high risk" and may eventually lose their right to be 
re-enrolled in any FMO. (Soup kitchens and self-help groups will no doubt assist 
these misfits.)

<P>To rein in abuse of specialty shops and gourmet restaurants, 
access to these establishments will be controlled by the primary food providers. 
They will serve as "gatekeepers" and decide whether and when a consumer should 
be referred to specialty providers such as Italian bakeries or French restaurants. 
Their decisions will be guided by their conviction that packaged breads and 
cakes or fast food can meet the same nutritional needs as delicatessen foods. 
They also recognize that the more money from a fixed, capitated amount that consumers 
spend on outlandish food, the less will remain for primary food providers.

<P>The 
proponents of Managed Foodcare sum up their argument by pointing out that 
their proposal preserves and protects genuine American values. The new laws support 
yearly renewable consumer choice, and at the same time reduce unnecessary 
and costly culinary options. They encourage corporate and individual responsibility 
by rewarding thoughtful management of food supply and demand. Capitation will 
further thriftiness, invention, and imaginative sales practices. Ultimately, 
Managed Foodcare will accelerate the accumulation of capital in the hands of those 
who know best how to promote a healthier and leaner American. <B>--Dr. Karl-Otto
