    <td> Preparing the end of a coax feedline for connector installation with
	ordinary hand tools takes a fair amount of skill and care. Various layers of
	insulation and outer braid must be cleanly cut away at locations appropriate
	to he connector being installed. For the first several decades of the history
	of BNC connector installation, the technician used a sharp knife, a deft touch
	and some degree of skill and practice for "eye-balling" the right dimensions.
	Like all hand-operations, the risk for having to start over due to lack of
	diligence was moderately high.<p>
	
	A number of clever tool manufactures now offer devices fitted with multiple
	blades, each one spaced appropriately for strip lengths and set for proper
	depth of cut. One such tool is illustrated here:
	
	I purchased this off Ebay for about $10.

There's a host of stripping tool alternatives on the market. Most will NOT be
advertised as suitable for RG-142/RG-400. The tool illustrated here was advertised
for RG-59/RG-59. As received, he blades were set appropriately for RG-142 without further
adjustment but it would not have been difficult to re-adjust as needed.<p>

I did an Ebay search on "coax strippers" and found a dozen varieties of tools
and suppliers. Perhaps 1/3 of the offerings included the adjustment feature.
