<CENTER><h2>"Got Rocks?"<P>by Unknown:</h2></CENTER>


One day an expert in time management was speaking to a group of business students and, to drive home
a point, used an illustration those students will never forget. As he stood in front of the group of
high powered overachievers he said, "Okay, time for a quiz."<P>

Then he pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouthed Mason jar and set it on the table in front of him.
Then he produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a time, into the
jar. When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, "Is this jar
full?" Everyone in the class said, "Yes."<P>

Then he said, "Really?" He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. Then he dumped
some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the space
between the big rocks. Then he asked the group once more, "Is the jar full?"<P>

By this time the class was on to him. "Probably not," one of them answered. "Good!" he replied. He
reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in the jar and
it went into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once more he asked the
question, "Is this jar full?"<P>

No!" the class shouted. Once again he said, "Good." Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to
pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. Then he looked at the class and asked, "What is the
point of this illustration?" One eager beaver raised his hand and said, "The point is, no matter how
full your schedule is, if you try really hard you can always fit some more things in it!"<P>

"No," the speaker replied, "that's not the point. The truth this illustration teaches us is: If you
don't put the big rocks in first, you'll never get them in at all."  What are the 'big rocks' in
your life?  Your children; Your loved ones; Your education; Your dreams; A worthy cause; Teaching or
mentoring others; Doing things that you love; Time for yourself; Your health; Your significant
other.<P>

Remember to put these BIG ROCKS in first or you'll never get them in at all. If you sweat the little
stuff (the gravel, the sand) then you'll fill your life with little things you worry about that
don't really matter, and you'll never have the real quality time you need to spend on the big,
important stuff (the big rocks).<P>

So, tonight, or in the morning, when you are reflecting on this short story, ask yourself this
question: What are the 'big rocks' in my life? Then, put those in your jar first.<P>
