<CENTER><h3>"THE ART OF WAR - Sun Tzu and Four American Presidents"<P>by TOM ADKINS</h3></CENTER>

Over two thousand years ago, an ancient Chinese warrior wrote a brief
book on warfare.  His name was Sun Tzu. His book, The Art Of War, is now
a staple for virtually any military strategic training.  Sun Tzu barely
mentioned weaponry. Instead, he focused on strategies .... strategies
that convert to winning and losing. His insights into the nature of
competition, battle and diplomacy apply to virtually every aspect of
life, from the battlefield to the boardroom, from the football arena to
the global arena.  Within this context, let's briefly examine the
greatest challenges of our four most recent American presidents.<P>

<B>KUMBAYA DIPLOMACY: JIMMY CARTER VERSUS LEONID BREZHNEV 1976-1980</B><P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"I say: Know your enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated.  When
you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal.  If
ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle." -Sun Tzu </H4></I></CENTER><P>

From the end of World War Two, United States foreign policy towards the
Soviet Union was essentially a "keep up with the Jones-ski's."  If the
Soviets made a bomb, we made a bomb.  If the Soviets built a tank, we
built a tank. Essentially, we treaded water.<P>

Jimmy Carter was the first president to buck that trend.  Carter slashed
our military and proposed we become buddies with the Soviets.  The
Soviet Union promptly took over ten countries.  When the USSR marched into
Afghanistan, Carter responded by withdrawing from the Olympics.  Carter
didn't understand that leaders bent upon world domination usually aren't
concerned with track and field events.<P>

During Carter's term, world leaders smelled his weakness. The OPEC nations pulled back production of
oil, driving prices to four times their 1976 level.  This created "Stagflation," when energy prices
skyrocketing regardless of economic conditions.  The cost of everything rose overnight, crushing the
American economy.<P>

But Carter wasn't done.  He decided that it would be wonderful to put
virtually the entire nation on the dole.  All sorts of government
entitlement programs were created and expanded. Few worked and most of
them caused heavy damage. Taxes rose.  The economy slumped.  Interest
rates quadrupled.  Poverty rose.  The economy staggered.<P>

All because Carter wanted to play horseshoes with the Soviet Union, who
essentially wanted to destroy the United States.  Carter invited them to
a tea party.  The Soviets showed up and played smash-mouth rugby.<P>

Our military was toothless, our intelligence organizations were hollow,
and our nation was floundering.  Carter left office with America on its
knees.  Nobody respected us, and we were powerless to show them
otherwise.<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"It is a doctrine of war not to assume the enemy will not come, but
rather to rely on one's readiness to meet him; not to presume that he
will not attack, but rather to make one's self invincible." -Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>
<B>
DEMANDING VICTORY, RONALD REAGAN VERSUS MIKHAIL GORBACHEV 1980-88</B><P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"To subdue the enemy without fighting is the supreme excellence." - Sun
Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

Ronald Reagan inherited a terrible economy, a nation with no
international respect, and a bold, expanding Soviet Union.  He tossed
away the old concept of military parity along with the Carter concept of
capitulation and took it upon himself to defeat the Soviet Union.<P>

Reagan recognized that a socialist economy barely functions.  By
rebuilding American armed forces, Reagan challenged the Soviet Union to
keep up.  They obliged. Our military spending increased to 27% of our
federal budget.  But the Soviets needed 60% of their budget to keep up.<P>

That math didn't work well for the USSR.  But the Soviets were willing
to bleed their people dry.<P>

<center><H4><I>"Nothing is more difficult than the art of maneuvering for advantageous
positions." - Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

Reagan had a stroke of brilliance.  The Soviets relied upon hard currency to maintain their
straining military budget.  And there was only one source of Soviet hard currency: Oil!  Reagan tripled the foreign aid to Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to about $3 billion each, but under the following conditions: 1-They stop fighting. 2-They buy American military hardware.  3-Saudi Arabia increase oil production to meet American demand.<P>

The Saudi's opened up the oil spigots.  Overnight, the price of oil
dropped below $20 per barrel.  In one fell swoop, Reagan brought peace
to the middle east, boosted the American economy with lower energy prices,
and eliminated the only source of money to fund the Soviet army.  It
actually became more expensive for the Russians to pump oil than it was
worth.  The USSR was on its knees, ripe for defeat.  Shortly after,
Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative.  The USSR tossed in
its hand.  Within 24 months, the USSR was no longer in existence.<P>

To this day, our economy benefits from lower oil prices and less
military spending. All because Reagan won the Cold War.<P>

That victory wasn't the sum of efforts from previous presidents.  Reagan
alone won the Cold War.  Without firing a shot.  Few give him credit for
his utter political brilliance.  When Reagan left office, America held
unprecedented prestige and strength.<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"The victories won by a master of war gain him neither reputation for
wisdom nor merit for courage.  How subtle and insubstantial, that the
expert leaves no trace. How divinely mysterious, that he is inaudible.
Thus, he is master of his enemy's fate." -Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

<B>HERDING CATS: GEORGE BUSH VERSUS SADDAAM HUSSEIN 1990-1992</B><P>

<CENTER>
<H4><I>"A speedy victory is the main object in war." - Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER>

Sometimes, diplomacy is as delicate as gossamer.  Sometimes diplomacy is
a sledgehammer.  And sometimes, it's both.  The first serious challenge
to George Bush's "New World Order" was issued by Saddaam Hussein.
Everyone knew Reagan didn't take any crap from anyone.  Like all
bullies, Hussein was anxious to test the mettle of this new president the
press labeled as a "Wimp".<P>

Big mistake.<P>

Every world leader should know better than to believe the American
press.  Not only did Bush have iron balls, he had brilliant diplomatic
skills. He actually knitted the whole world into a blanket of agreement against
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. This political accomplishment was like
herding a hundred cats.  Except cats with nuclear claws, bad attitudes, and
ones who often hated one another.<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"While we have heard of stupid haste in war, we have not yet seen a
clever operation that was prolonged." - Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

The armed forces Reagan had built were ready, and this coalition was
armed with American equipment and training.  When Hussein's army was
crushed in 100 hours, the world collectively took notice.  Few challenges
followed.<P>

American liberals whined that this was a war over oil.  No kidding.  And
who suffers most from high oil prices?  We can guess Ross Perot isn't
starving when his oil bill goes up 50 cents a gallon.  But poor people
do. Thus American liberals -- as always -- were willing to sacrifice
their constituents as political pawns, proving once again that, stupidity,
arrogance and power lust are the backbone of the Democratic
Party.  Unfortunately, that represents about half the nation.<P>

When the Gulf War was over, the United States enjoyed its peak influence
in the world.  Nobody doubted any facet of our nation whatsoever.  In
less than ten years, Reagan and Bush took America from laughingstock to
absolute respect.<P>

Say what you want about Bush.  He was uncomfortable.  Boring.  And he
didn't discuss his underwear on MTV.  But diplomatically, he was
brilliant, perhaps better than Reagan.  He knew what had to be done.  He
knew it was a monumental task.  He knew how to do it.  And he did it.
Bush left office with America unquestionably the only world superpower,
allies all over the globe, and very few enemies.<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"The general who in advancing does not seek personal fame, and in
withdrawing is not concerned with avoiding punishment, but whose only
purpose is to protect the people and promote the best interests of his
sovereign is like a precious jewel to the state." -Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

<B>DIPLOMATIC GRAFFITI: BILL CLINTON VERSUS CHINA</B><P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"Appraise war in terms of the fundamental factors. The first of these
factors is moral influence." - Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

Befuddled Americans think Bill Clinton's major war is in Yugoslavia.
Actually, Clinton's war is with China.  And he already lost.  Under
Clinton's watch, China has successfully stolen, bought, or was simply
given the blueprints for every modern American nuclear weapon -- and the
guidance systems to accurately deliver them. Like Reagan's brilliant
victory over the Soviet Union, China never fired a shot.  They simply
waited until we had a corruptible president, and simply corrupted him.<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"One who is not acquainted with the designs of his neighbors should not
enter into alliances with them." - Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

Bill Clinton's political prostitution has never been questioned ... it's
always been a matter of price.  Wise world leaders have long recognized
Clinton as an egotistical political charlatan, capable of being elected
in a nation enamored with personality and ignorant of wisdom.  Such
leaders aren't spun by James Carville and Dan Rather.  Instead, they
laugh at Clinton's bumbling and self-aggrandizement.  Then take
advantage of him. No wonder the Chinese wanted Clinton to be president.<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"All warfare is based on deception. There is no place where espionage is
not used.  Offer the enemy bait to lure him." - Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

The political greed of Clinton and his Democrats drove them directly
into the Chinese espionage trap.  Like all nations, China has been snooping
around for years, picking up a snippet here, a spoonful there. But under
Clinton's watch, China got the entire bag of goodies.  It wasn't even
expensive.  For a few million dollars to the DNC, China gained complete
access and even protection via Janet Reno's Justice Department.  When
Clinton's people discovered the damage, they did nothing.  When the
damage came to light, Clinton's administration tried to blame everyone
else.  What could they do?  Admit their treason?<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"Those who excel in war first cultivate their own humanity and justice
and maintain their laws and institutions.  By these means they make
their governments invincible." - Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

Clinton inherited a world that respected America, and like a drunken
gambler, parlayed American prestige into the gutter. He managed to
destroy the careful coalition of nations aligned against Iraq.  He
ruined world confidence in NATO.  He managed to weaken Russia as a
state, yet strengthen its diplomatic presence.  He strengthened China's hand
unimaginably, creating instability in the region.  He simultaneously stoked
the nuclear fires between India and Pakistan, two wary but previously
contented enemies.  Now, rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran are
stretching their claws, armed with Chinese missiles which can reach America.
And Taiwan is just a bit edgier today.<P>

When Clinton leaves office, America will have less friends than his
first day as President.  Thanks to Reagan and Bush, the United States isn't
on her knees.  But Clinton proved America is willing to turn a few tricks
for the right price.<P>

<CENTER><H4><I>"When the leader is morally weak and his discipline not strict, when his
instructions and guidance are not enlightened, when there are no
consistent rules ... Neighboring rulers will take advantage of this". -
Sun Tzu</I></H4></CENTER><P>

Every nation is perpetually at war. For a president, every move, every
word, every action has consequences to the entire nation from that
moment well into the future.  The concepts behind successfully leading a
nation are not new, but the, arrogant and power-hungry seem to create
endless varieties of how to commit the same mistakes. The less we pay
attention, the greater damage each mistake creates.<P>

On this Memorial Day, remember those who fought for our nation,
especially those who gave their lives so we may be free.  Consider how
easily their sacrifice can be squandered.  And how often it has
happened.<P>

And whether you will ever let that happen to another American son or
daughter.<P>
