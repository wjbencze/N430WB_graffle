      . . . . some conversation on "welding cable versus
      the "good stuff" . . . .

  The insulations are indeed different . . . tefzel and cousins
  don't support combustion but they give off equally noxious if
  not downright toxic fumes when the wires they contain are overheated.
  We're talking red-heat type temperatures here too . . . not impossible
  to generate in a battery cable with an RG battery but very difficult.

  I'm thinking the "welding" cable he was comparing was not welding
  cable but some other material.  All the welding cables I've worked
  with are designed to be VERY flexible and able to withstand a lot
  of abuse (trucks run over them, they get handled a lot). The wire
  stranding is VERY fine in order to achieve both flexibility and resistance
  to flexure stresses. If the cable he was showing you had fewer,
  heavier strands, it WASN'T welding cable . . . got it off a golf
  cart maybe?

>This makes a difference

  Total BS.   So called "skin effect" comes into play in the megahertz
  frequency range and is insignificant below tens of megahertz. It
  doesn't happen at DC.


>He couldn't offer any specific comparison in terms of Ohms per foot however.

>Lastly, the connectors are available for the aviation cable but do not fit

  Perfectly suitable connectors are available for ANY size wire.

  Again, not consistent with the physics of the matter.
  See <a href=big_term.pdf>this article on soldering fat terminals onto big wires.</a>
  I've been soldering things together for over 35 years including 
  some wiring that carried over 1000  amps . . . I can't even imagine 
  the failure mode being described here.

>It seems to me that with a well planned electrical system (assuming battery

  True . . . ACS gets about $3.75/ft for #2 and we get $1.75 when we
  have it in stock (which reminds me, I'm about out and need to chase
  down anohter spool).  However, for airplanes with the battery in
  back, runs are longer. Canard pushers with battery on opposite end
  of airplane from engine need two long runs. Here the weight is
  a bigger factor. #2 welding cable is heavier and bulkier but it's
  very soft and much easier to work with.  In fact, if you want to
  run #2 wiring throughout the cranking circuit, I would RECOMMEND
  welding cable be used for connections to the battery. These connections
  tend to be short jumpers between battery and ground or battery and
  contactor.  #2 aircraft wire is so stiff that it's hard to work with
  on short bend radii and stresses it's terminals more. Use #2 aircraft
  wire everywhere else but nice, flexible battery connections are very
  nice to work with. The afformentioned hazards are about as remote 
  as your wing falling off so for my money, it's a toss up. If you 
  can stand the weight difference and wish to use REAL welding cable 
  (go buy new stuff from a welder's supply), I don't perceive any 
  great sins happening here.

  Every airplane has an un-interruptable source of power . . . called a
  battery.  This pre-supposes that the battery is maintained well. We
  tend to treat batteries pretty badly in airplanes . . . run 'em until
  they refuse to crank an engine any more. By that time, their usefulness
  as a backup power source has been gone for months.  Run
  periodic capacity checks on a battery, and replace it at 50% of
  capacity (or some higher number you choose).  If you don't run
  capacity checks, then put a new battery in every two years. For
  airplanes with total dependence on electrical power, we suggest 
  two half-sized batteries with alternator-out loads distributed between
  the two batteries depending on system needs. In this case, we suggest
  replacing one battery every year. This way, you always have one battery
  less than 1 year old, no battery is more than 2 years old.

  If you can go "total electric panel" there are options for replacing
  the vacuum pump with a 20 amp aux alternator. This permits total
  redundancy of power generation and storage for very little weight
  penalty compared to classic alternator/battery/vacuum pump
  installations.
