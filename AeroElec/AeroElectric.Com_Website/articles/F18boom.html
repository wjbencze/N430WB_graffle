Every so often, the right combination of conditions converge to
create a spectacular event - in this case an F-18 passing through the
sound barrier.<P>

The water vapor, density and temperature were just right, and there
just happened to be a camera in the vicinity to capture the moment.
The F-18 is in transonic flight, with normal shock waves emanating
from behind the canopy and across the wings and fuselage.  The condition
will last for only an instant. Once supersonic flow exists completely
around the aircraft, sharp-angled sonic cones replace the normal shock
waves.<P>

The odds against capturing an image like this are staggering.
