	to carry it's share of the loads was reduced and current flow was concentrated

	This failure was that it did not progress
	to catastrophic loss of ability the switch to function - a secondary effect
	was created	when the contact rocker curvature progressed far enough to cause
	the short circuit and pop the fuse. The switch wasn't going to run much longer but this
	is an interesting case where there was a race going on between two separate
	symptoms of switch failure (1) open contacts or (2) curvature of the rocker
	sufficient to cause the short.<p>
	
	Now, had the builder simply reversed the wires going to the switch on initial
	assembly, the switch would still have "shorted" first . . . but it would have
	gone unnoticed because the short was on the load side of the switch. In this
	case, the switch would have lasted a few more flights before failing to operate
	the strobes at all. </b>

<h3><b>Analysis:<p></h3>

This failure took many flight hours to progress to the point were first symptoms
of failure were evident. The uniform curvature of the contact rocker suggests that
the rocker was slowly and uniformly heated to an annealed condition where the rocker
was "hammered" into a curved shape by a succession of operations between the ON and
OFF states. While heating is maximum at the time the switch is moved from ON to OFF,
one might expect maximum curvature to be on the OFF side where a contact rocker
is being moved from ON to OFF in a heated condition. In this case, there was a
bit MORE curvature on the non-current-carrying. This suggests that while the hammering
forces that distorted the rocker are uniform from side to side, it had the greatest
effect while the contact rocker assembly was hottest, i.e. moving from ON to OFF.
<p>

How should we react to this knowledge? I've oft suggested that switches die more
often from effects of time and environment than they do for wear-out or overload.
This instance is a good example. The switch was not mis-applied. It was
being operated under conditions well within ratings. I'll suggest that this switch
reached the end of its service life under conditions that prevailed. Should we
recommend that the builder replace the switches in his airplane with devices
perceived to be of higher quality? EVERY device has a service life.<p>

This case emphasizes the value of crafting a failure tolerant system. It also
illustrates the validity of a preventative maintenance practice I've suggested
often: "When you experience your first switch failure, replace ALL the switches."
Now, if your airplane were fitted with rows of $high$ switches - especially those
with screw terminals, the idea of spending time, effort and dollars to shot-gun
the whole panel with new switches is pretty daunting. But if you've installed $5
switches with fast-on terminals and hex mounting nuts, I'll suggest that you can
renew every switch on the panel for less than $50 in less than an hour on a Saturday afternoon
with only a nut driver for tools. You shouldn't even have to crawl under the panel.<p>

No doubt some will counsel this builder to "get that junk off the panel and put
some REAL switches in there." Bad advice? Not at all. Super-whippy switches will
probably last longer. But at what cost of ownership? I'll suggest that under the
failure tolerant design philosophy one can built perfectly useful systems from
low cost components and not compromise safety. When the components are inexpensive
-AND- easy to replace, cost of ownership goes down without compromising comfortable
flight.
