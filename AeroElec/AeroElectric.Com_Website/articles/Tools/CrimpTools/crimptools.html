    <td> It seems that the 'Connection website was recently found lacking in depth of
	detail for explaining the simple-ideas upon which the reliable and economical
	application of solderless terminals are based. Having acquired some new
	toys for peering ever closer at visual manifestations of these simple ideas,
	I went off to the workbench and assembled the following article that will trade
	off the significance of differences between an El-Cheapo and Hi-Dollar tool
	for the installation of top-of-the-line terminals on wires. <p>
	The tool pictured on the left is an Asian knockoff of a family of relatively
	low cost tools made in the US for terminal installation. It has ratchet controlled
	handles that force the tool to be cycled through a full stroke against hard stops
	so that uniformity of crimp height is guaranteed. This tool sells from B&C's
	website catalog for about $40.<p>
	
	The tool pictured on the right is the Amp "t-head" tool for red (18-22AWG)
	and blue (14-16AWG) terminals. I purchased this tool at Cessna salvage about 1965
	for $20 as I recall. I sent it back to AMP for refurbishment at a cost of $75.
	At that time, I think the tool sold new for about $150. Today, it's about $600.<p>

    <td>Let's begin with a couple of red PIDG terminals attached to a piece
        of 22AWG wire using the two tools described above. The terminal on the
		left was installed with the El-Cheapo tool.<p>
		
		Note that the Hi-Dollar tool produces a more sculptured appearance to
		the crimp. The El-Cheapo dies are shaped in a uniform, squashed cylinder.
		The Hi-Dollar dies are more artistically shaped by folks who have
		made a lifetime career in wire termination technology. No doubt there
		are benefits to be realized from the extra effort but let us compare
		the final results . . .

    <td>Here's where the "rubber hits the road" (or wire hits the terminal).
	I cut the two terminals through the wiregrip center and polished the
	ends as best I could with tools available here. The scratches you see
	here are from the grit size of a synthetic ruby hone I use to renew the
	edge on X-Acto knife blades. Even this fine abrasive is pretty coarse
	for the task at hand . . . but I think the idea is clear.<p>
	Note that there are no voids in the wire grip area for either terminal.
	If I had a better polishing tool, you would be able to see individual
	strands captured in the terminal wire grip barrel. The 500 microinch
	or so thickness of tin plating on each strand would be visible as 
	squashed ovals traced in the copper surface. I'll try to get some terminals
	properly polished and replace these photos with some that show this
	level of detail.<p>
	Bottom line is that both tools produce volume within the finished crimp
	that has become a single solid mass with no voids.

	 We can see striking difference in how the tools close the
	 insulation grip. In fact, I believe the term "diamond grip"
	 used in Amp's trade name for their terminals and tools comes from
	 the very neat closure of metal down around the wire. Note that
	 the nylon outer jacket on both crimps could NOT be depended upon
	 for insulation support.<p>
	 Okay, the crimp on the left is UGLY . . . but is it functional?

	tool. If I were putting multiple wires into a single terminal, I can
	open up the insulation grip to accommodate the larger cross-section
	of wires. This adjustment has NO EFFECT on height of the wire grip.<p>
	The El-Cheapo dies are the same for both grips and symetrical such
	that it matters not which way the terminal is inserted into the tool.

    <td>The Hi-Dollar tool has a spring loaded stop that helps you properly
	position the terminal in the tool. The stop positions the terminal flag
	flat with the plane of the crimp.  The terminal wire grip barrel
	sets against the stop to control centering in the tool. It also provides
	a stop for wire insertion to make sure the bared strands are positioned
	just flush with the end of the terminal at crimp time.<p>
	
	For the El-Cheapo, just center the plastic barrel in the jaws and orient
	the terminal flag parallel to the plane of the crimp. Closing the tool
	down to the first "click" will capture the terminal in proper position.
	You have to watch the free end of the terminal during wire insertion
	so that exposed strands are just flush with the end of the wire grip.

There's a host of crimp tool alternatives on the market. Without spending the
time and effort to do a similar analysis of each tool, I'm not prepared to offer
a learned opinion as to the suitability of other tools. It's a fair bet that
a tool offered by a widely distributed name brand is just as capable (if not
more so) than Mr. El-Cheapo featured in this article. Other low cost tools may
provide more artful sculpting of the finished crimp and may require more attention
to positioning the fresh terminal in the tool.<p>

As a general rule, tools with unsymetrical dies will have a smaller, closed-die
cross section on the wire grip side.<p>

I put this together in something of a hurry. I'd be pleased to hear about 
errors of spelling or grammar . . . or suggestions for expanding the explanation
in useful ways.
