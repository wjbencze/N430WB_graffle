Smart (Current Sensing) Annunciation  . . .<br></H1></Center>

<hr>
<P>
<font size=5>A number of builders have asked about adding annunciator
lights to indicate when various systems are in the ON state. The first
thought that comes to mind is to simply connect a lamp to the output side
of the controlling switch . . . switch ON, light ON.<p>

Suppose you could build a device that not only shows that the switch is
ON, but that the device controlled by that switch is really drawing current?
This could be an important component of the annunciator indication . . . not
only is power being applied to the switched device, that device is intact and
drawing current. By sensing both voltage and current, the annunciator lamp
can be made to stay dark if, for example, a navigation light bulb is burned
out, a landing light is shot, or a pitot heater is burned out.<p>

Many of you may be aware of modern automotive designs that use sophisticated,
integrated circuits to sense accessory current and operate the annunciator lamp. These
are neat chips, easy to obtain and use . . . provided you're reasonably gifted
with the use of a soldering iron and perhaps etched circuit board layouts. The
technique I'm going to describe uses a simple magnetic sensing device called
a "reed switch"<p>

<font size=5><a href = rtangle1.jpg>Click here for larger image</a> A visit with
camera in hand to a production line of certified piston aircraft allowed me
to record and share a fabrication technique for soft penetration. This technique
has a long history of laboratory testing for effectiveness, production line
convenience, and field maintainability. In this case, all of the wiring comes
through a single penetration fitting . . . but there's no reason why
multiple, smaller fittings wouldn't work too . . .<p>

Here we see how a stainless weldment bolted to the firewall with steel
hardware provides the structural component of a transition for wires and
other relatively "soft" materials that need to run from cockpit to engine
compartment. Note generous flange area outside the tube to flange interface
that is sealed with fire-stop when the flange is bolted into place.

<font size=5><a href = rtangle2.jpg>Click here for larger image</a>  The fittings
for this airplane are made from 0.050" stainless. Thickness and attaching
geometry are a function of how much support the fitting needs to provide for
the bundle of transitioning wires and tubes.  The material shown here is pretty
hefty stuff and may have been selected as handier to weld than thinner material.<p>

Builders can certainly experiment with thinner material and alternative joining
techniques. Periodic inspections will show whether or not there are issues of mechanical
robustness . . . not strong enough, they'll simply come apart. Given that fires
are VERY rare, the failure of an experimental fitting doesn't represent a
great threat as long as you do reasonably complete inspections during normal
P/M activities . . . like every oil change. The worst thing that happens is
that you have to build a more robust transition fitting and replace the broken one.<p>

up the business end of the finished transition. What's not visible in this
view is the packing placed around wires so that the second hose clamp
doesn't have to put a super-crush on the fire sleeve . . . . more on
this later.<p>

firewall penetration.  A second hose clamp brings the fire sleeve down for
a snug fit on the wire bundle. If necessary, a filler around the wire bundle
makes for a better seal with less crush under the second hose clamp . . .

<font size=5><a href = straight1.jpg>Click here for larger image</a> On another
airplane, we find a similar technique except that the stainless steel 
firewall fitting is straight, no 90-degree bend. Otherwise, installation and
functionality is same as shown above.<p>

<font size=5><a href = straight2.jpg>Click here for larger image</a> This view
illustrates an interesting packing material used to build up the wire
bundle size. A piece of fire sleeve was cut down the side and made into
a kind of wrapping tape. Note that all exposed edges of the fire sleeve
are "doped" with the recommended sealer to preclude entry of moisture
and to keep the edges from fraying . . .<p>
