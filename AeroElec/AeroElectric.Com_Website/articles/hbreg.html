<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>We hear the word "experimental" used within the sport aviation industry on a regular basis. The most
common use of experimental applies to a classification of an airworthiness certificate used for a
custom built airplane. This is different from the airworthiness category assigned to an airplane that is
mass produced by a manufacturer which is then sold to the general public. I will explore the exact
meaning of the word experimental later in this article. Suffice to say that FARs (Federal Aviation
Regulations) pertaining to the operation of experimental airplanes can be confusing. I will attempt to
clarify the confusion that exists and to simplify the regulations as they apply to building an airplane.
Each phase of building and operating an amateur-built airplane will be discussed along with the
applicable regulations.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>In general, we are very privileged to have only a minimum number of regulations that actually pertain
to building and flying our amateur-built airplanes. When a manufacturer plans to mass produce an
airplane, they are required by FARs to comply with design standards that are detailed in FAR Part 23.
This regulation is very restrictive as to design, weight, speed, etc. Amateur builders are not restricted
by Part 23 or any other certification regulation. Basically, our only restriction is that we must
construct and assemble the majority of the airplane. (Most airplane kit manufacturers actually
voluntarily comply with the guidelines of Part 23.) Part 23 is titled "Airworthiness Standards: Normal,
utility, acrobatic and commuter category airplanes." As the builder of our own airplane, which will not
be mass produced, we are limited only by our imagination and ingenuity. Of course, when we build
our own airplane we are going to impose strict limitations and restrictions concerning quality of
construction, materials used, etc. We certainly want a safe, reliable airplane to fly and in which to
carry our passengers.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>Let's define the "experimental" category and see how it applies to our amateur-built airplane. To
legally fly within the United States, we must have four documents on board: an airworthiness
certificate, a registration certificate, a copy of the operating limitations, and the weight and balance
for our airplane. Airworthiness certificates are classified under two categories according to FAR
21.175 - standard and special. Standard airworthiness certificates are issued for most production
airplanes and they are usually classed under the normal category. We are interested in special
airworthiness certificates that are further broken down into several additional categories of which
one is "experimental." Experimental airworthiness certificates are issued for different purposes. These
purposes are: (1) research and development, (2) to conduct flight tests to show compliance with
airworthiness regulations, (3) for crew training, (4) for exhibition, (5) for air racing, (6) to conduct
market surveys and sales demonstrations, (7) to operate an amateur-built airplane, and (8) to
operate a kit-built aircraft that was assembled by a person from a kit manufactured by the holder of a
production certificate for that kit.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>We will primarily concern ourselves with purpose number 7, to operate an amateur-built airplane.
Fully 95% of all airplanes that we build from a set of plans or from a kit will be certificated under the
amateur-built classification. Purpose number 8, the kit plane classification, only applies to kit
manufacturers who have certified their airplane under a type certificate termed a "primary category"
aircraft. To date, only one kit plane manufacturer falls in this category to my knowledge. All other kit
plane manufacturers sell their kits to be classed under the experimental certificate for the purpose of
operating an amateur-built aircraft. FAR 21.191(g) is the heart of all regulations for the builder of an
airplane. This regulation states the following: "Operating amateur-built aircraft. Operating an aircraft
the major portion of which has been fabricated and assembled by persons who undertook the project
solely for their own education or recreation." This regulation is the essence of custom aircraft
building. The intent of the classification is very clear. Notice that one or more persons may build the
airplane but they must build it only for their own enjoyment or education.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>Ultralight airplanes fall under a different set of rules. If your completed airplane meets the
requirements of FAR 103.1, it is classed as an ultralight vehicle and as such does not require an
airworthiness certificate. Briefly, these requirements are: single pilot, used for recreation only,
weighing less than 254 pounds empty weight, fuel capacity not to exceed 5 U.S. gallons, not capable
of more than 55 knots in level flight, and a power-off stall speed not exceeding 24 knots. As you can
readily observe, the majority of custom built airplanes exceeds one or more of these criteria. Often,
the owner of an ultralight airplane will choose to certificate their aircraft under the experimental
category. This is usually done to comply with the regulations regarding weight, passengers, etc. Note
that the operator of an ultralight does not have to be a certificated pilot contrasted to the operator of
an amateur-built airplane who, of course, must be a licensed pilot and the holder of a current medical
certificate.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>To continue our discussion of FAR 21.191(g), it is clear that to certificate an airplane under the
experimental category for amateur-built operation, we must assemble and construct at least 51% of
the airplane. The FAA emphasizes this restriction in at least two publications. The first is FAA Order
8130.2C, which is the airworthiness certification manual used by FAA Inspectors as a guide to inspect
an airplane and to issue an airworthiness certificate. On page 116 of that guide, the following
guidelines appear under the eligibility section. (1) "Amateur-built aircraft may be eligible for an
experimental airworthiness certificate when the applicant presents satisfactory evidence that the
aircraft was fabricated and assembled by an individual or group of individuals." This section goes on
to state that the project must be undertaken for educational or recreational purposes and the FAA
must find that the airplane complies with acceptable standards. Aircraft that are manufactured and
assembled as a business for sale are not considered to be amateur-built. This statement appears
within the Order: "NOTE: Amateur-built kit owner(s) will jeopardize eligibility for certification under
FAR 21.191(g) if someone else builds the airplane." The applicant for amateur-built certification must
sign a notarized form (FAA Form 8130-12), certifying the major portion was fabricated and assembled
for educational or recreational purposes, and that evidence is available to support the statement. The
second place the 51% rule is emphasized is in Advisory Circular 20-27D on page 5 under 7(b). This
section simply emphasizes the major portion rule.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>When you purchase an airplane kit from a manufacturer, the kit should be listed on the FAA listing of
kits that have been evaluated to ensure that 51% of the building will be completed by the purchaser
(this is commonly known as the major portion rule). I want to emphasize that the FAA in no way
endorses any of these kits or do they approve kit manufacturers. They simply evaluate the kits solely
for the purpose of determining if an aircraft built from the kit will meet the major portion criteria. A
listing of these kits is available from your local FAA office. I do not recommend purchasing a kit that is
not on this listing unless you are prepared to prove to the FAA Inspector that the kit meets the proper
criteria.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>The FAA does not expect the builder to personally fabricate every part of the airplane. A number of
items can be purchased and several tasks can be contracted commercially. FAA Advisory Circular
20-139, titled "Commercial Assistance During Construction of Amateur-Built Aircraft," provides a very
detailed guide concerning what can be purchased complete and what can be contracted
commercially. Engines, propellers, wheel and brake assemblies, and standard aircraft hardware are
examples of items that may be purchased. Installation of avionics, painting an airplane, upholstery
items are examples of tasks that may be contracted. The bottom line of the entire discussion is that
you must prove to the FAA Inspector who issues your airworthiness certificate that you have
complied with FAR 21.191(g). Next month we will discuss the necessary documentation to present to
the inspector to assure your compliance.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>If you decide to allow someone else to build your airplane to be certificated as amateur-built, you will
be required to license it under the experimental category for the purpose of exhibition. This category
is much more restrictive than amateur-built. The purpose of this category is to allow the holder to
exhibit their airplane at air shows, motion pictures, television filming, etc., and, of course, to fly to
and from these productions. I will not spend time discussing this category since it is rarely used.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>Now that I have discussed the general regulations concerning building your airplane, I will detail
specific regulations as they apply to each phase of building, flying, and maintaining an amateur-built
airplane. I would recommend that you obtain a copy of the regulations for your own reference.
Several books are available that contain the FARs along with computer discs containing all of the FAA
regulations. The FAA also maintains a web site with all regulations. This site can be found at
www.faa.gov</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>INITIAL BUILDING PHASE</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>The first phase of construction is, of course, the building phase. I would highly recommend that
before you begin your project you ask your local FAA office for their information packet that is
available relating to amateur-built airplanes. The part of this packet that you will refer to regularly is
Advisory Circular 20-27D. Regarding regulations governing the first phase, we have discussed in
detail FAR 21.191(g). Another regulation, FAR 21.173, presents the eligibility for an airworthiness
certificate. FAR 21.191 defines all purposes that are allowed for licensing under the experimental
category including, of course, amateur-built. FAR 21.175 defines the classifications of airworthiness
certificates. FAR 21.193 contains the information that must be submitted for an experimental
certificate. Advisory Circular 20-27D presents this information much more completely. FAA Part 45
details the markings that are necessary for your aircraft with respect to what is required, size,
location, etc. FAR 45.23 is where we are told that we will display the word "experimental" in letters
not less than 2 inches high nor more than 6 inches high near the entrance to the cabin or cockpit. FAR
45.29 provides us with the size of registration marks and specifically allows us, as owners of
experimental aircraft, to use three inch high numbers and letters providing our maximum cruising
speed is less than 180 knots. If our cruising speed is higher than 180 knots, then we are required to
use 12 inch letters and numbers. An additional regulation applies if our airplane had an experimental
certificate issued more than 30 years ago. This regulation allows us to use numbers and letters only
two inches high. FAR 45.22 specifies the rules as they apply to the older airplanes. Details of spacing,
width, and other factors are discussed in this section.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>Continuing the building stage, FAR 47.15 informs us about registration numbers. You may select an
"N" number of your choice providing the number is currently not in use on another airplane. FAR
47.33 lists the information that must be submitted with your application for the "N" number. If you
intend to fly your airplane at night or under Instrument Flight Rules, you are required to have specific
equipment. The necessary equipment, including instruments, radios, etc. is outlined in FAR 91.205.
This regulation also tells you what is needed for VFR flight during the day. FAR 91.207 outlines the
requirements for emergency locator transmitters (ELT). The requirements for an ELT are basically the
same for all airplanes, including amateur-built. It should be noted that if you remain within 50
nautical miles of your home airport and you are engaged in flight training, you are not required to
have an ELT. Also, if you have a single place airplane, you are not required to install an ELT.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>Obviously, there are a number of other issues involved in the building phase. In next month's article, I
will present a detailed checklist of the items you will need to certificate your aircraft under
amateur-built. At that time I will also talk about the FAA inspection process and the required
documentation and papers. After the FAA inspects your airplane, the inspector will issue a set of
Operating Limitations. Those limitations then become regulations for operation of your aircraft and
they are actually part of the special airworthiness certificate. The airworthiness certificate will be
issued at the time of the inspection and will contain two phases. Phase 1 is the initial flight testing
phase of the aircraft, and Phase 2 lists the operating limitations that go into effect upon completion of
the flight testing. Phase 2 applies for the duration of the certificate.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>FLIGHT TESTING</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>FAR 91.305 defines a flight test area. Basically, it states that you must conduct your flight testing over
sparsely populated areas having light air traffic. FAR 91.319 provides a listing of operating limitations.
As I mentioned, when your aircraft is inspected you will be given a copy of operating limitations.
Usually, the inspector will issue Phase 1 and Phase 2 at the time of inspection providing you with two
sets of operating limitations: flight testing and subsequent operation. The flight test area is defined
within the Phase 1 limitations along with the required number of hours you must fly the aircraft. The
primary restrictions regarding flight testing are: (1) no passengers, (2) day, VFR only, (3) no
operation over congested areas, (4) you must advise ATC that you are experimental, and (5) the pilot
must have the appropriate ratings. Of course, the general operating rules under FAR Part 91 are
applicable. Phase 1 operating limitations have an expiration time of 12 months from date of issue. All
flight testing must be completed within that time period or the aircraft must be reinspected. One of
the restrictions in FAR 91.319 that is interesting is that in order to have the Phase restrictions lifted
you must prove that the aircraft has no hazardous operating characteristics and that it is controllable
throughout its normal range of speeds and maneuvers. The FAA has an Advisory Circular that is very
helpful in providing guidelines for flight testing. This circular, Advisory Circular 90-89, is necessary to
read prior to your first flight. Also, the EAA Flight Advisor Program is highly recommended. The flight
testing phase should be an enjoyable conclusion to your building experience and it will be if planned
and executed properly.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>NORMAL OPERATION OF YOUR AMATEUR-BUILT</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>Once again, all of the general operating rules under FAR Part 91 apply to daily operations of your
aircraft. In addition, the operating limitations presented under FAR 91.319 and as issued by the FAA
Inspector at the time of inspection govern. After completion of Phase 1, you are then allowed to carry
passengers and fly at night or IFR if so equipped. Phase 2 limitations do add some restrictions that
merit discussion. First of all, you may not carry passengers or property for hire. Secondly, any major
changes that are made to the airplane as defined by FAR 21.93 require inspection by the FAA prior to
further flight. A minor change is defined as one that has no appreciable effect on the weight, balance,
structure, or anything affecting the airworthiness. Examples of a major change would be a different
horsepower engine, a different pitch propeller, a change in basic design, etc. If a major change is
made, notify the FAA in writing providing the details of the change to ascertain whether or not an
inspection will be required. Thirdly, you may not operate your airplane unless it has received a
condition inspection (annual inspection). This will be discussed in the next section.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>MAINTAINING YOUR AIRPLANE</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>As I mentioned in the previous section, a condition inspection is required every 12 calendar months
on amateur-built aircraft. This check is similar to an annual inspection required by FAR Part 43 on
production airplanes. The Phase 2 Operating Limitations specifically refer to FAR Part 43, Appendix D,
as the guide to performing this inspection. The inspection can be performed by any licensed A&amp;P
mechanic, an FAA Approved Repair Station, or by the builder of the airplane provided the builder
obtains a "Repairman's Certificate" from the FAA. FAA Advisory Circular 65-23A is available for
information concerning application and privileges of this certificate. In short, the primary builder of
the airplane is eligible to apply for this certificate which then permits inspection of the airplane and a
logbook endorsement of the condition check. It is noteworthy that the primary builder must be one
person. If a group of people builds an airplane, only one can be designated as the primary builder. In
addition, the issuance of the repairman's certificate only applies to the one airplane that has been
built by the primary builder and no other airplane regardless of same type, etc.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>Normal maintenance on an experimental airplane can be performed virtually by anyone regardless of
credentials. Once again, this does not apply to the condition check previously discussed. You can
perform maintenance items on the engine whether or not it is "certified." Once a certified engine is
placed on an amateur-built aircraft and is operated, it no longer conforms to its type design. This
means that the engine can no longer be placed on any aircraft other than an amateur-built until it has
been inspected and found to meet its type design. It also must be found to be in a condition for safe
operation "airworthy." Once again, common sense should rule. We do not want to overhaul an engine
on our airplane unless we are equipped to do so with tools and proper knowledge.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>I will point out that FAR Part 43 specifically states that the rules of that part do not apply to
amateur-built airplanes. With that in mind, anyone can maintain the airplane. However, remember in
our earlier discussion that Part 43, Appendix D was referenced in Phase 2 operating limitations
presented to the builder at the time of inspection. It is referenced as a guide to be used in conducting
condition inspections. That means Part 43, Appendix D does apply to the condition inspection because
of this reference. The FAA has further clarified AD (Airworthiness Directives) as they apply to
amateur-built airplanes. Airworthiness Directives cannot apply to any part on an amateur-built
airplane unless that specific airplane is cited along with who should do the work and to what
standards. The reason for this is because once an approved part is placed on an experimental airplane
it is no longer considered an approved part. Again, let me emphasis that just because a regulation
does not require an action it still may be prudent and within our best interest to conform to an AD
note. We are striving to improve the safety record of this industry and in all cases we must act on the
side of common sense and good practice.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>REGULATIONS INVOLVING THE SALE OF YOUR AMATEUR-BUILT</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><STRONG>There are few regulations governing a sale of your airplane. The airworthiness certificate is
transferable with the airplane even though it is experimental (FAR 21.179). The proper bill of sale and
registration documents must be completed when you sell the airplane. Of particular interest is the
fact that the new owner may maintain the newly purchased airplane, but may not perform the
condition check. The repairman's certificate is not transferred with the airplane. It remains with the
original primary builder. That person legally may still perform the condition check if you can persuade
him to do so. If you are purchasing a partially completed kit you need to obtain the proper
documentation to ensure you will meet the major portion rule. FAA Advisory Circular 20-27D has the
following warning: "CAUTION: Purchasers of partially completed kits should obtain all fabrication and
assembly records from the previous owner(s). This may enable the builder who completes the aircraft
to be eligible for amateur-built certification." Once again, a call to your FAA Inspector will prevent
future problems. The time spent by the original builder is usually applied toward the total time
required to build the airplane. Documentation is necessary.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>
