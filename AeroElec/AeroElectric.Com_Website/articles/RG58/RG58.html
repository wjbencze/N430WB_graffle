This Shop Note was first published about summer of 2003 in response to several reader
reports of difficulty with RG-58 coax cable. This article suggests that the RG-58
can be replaced with a modern, high temperature shielded wire. I wrote the article
at the suggestion of several builders who had already made the substitution and reported
no problems with system performance.<p>

A few months after it was published, I received a fax from Lightspeed wherein Klaus
was upset about the article. Seems a builder reported not being able to get sparks
to jump between coil towers as called out in the post-installation acceptance testing.
After replacing the shielded wire with coax, the ability to get sparks to jump the
gap was restored.<p>

Klaus dressed me up one side and down the other about suggesting modifications to
his product without consulting him first. Seems his engineer has concerns about
capacity characteristics of coax versus shielded wire. Coax has slightly fewer
PICOfarads per foot than does shielded wire. He also cited some voltage concerns.  I'll have
to confess to a certain degree of arrogance for not consulting him first . . . but
then, the simple-ideas surrounding the substitution didn't seem to support much
concern. Yes, there is a pretty good voltage transient on this wire . . . but 
most shielded wire of this genre' is rated at 600v with a breakdown voltage in the
kilovolt range. Yes, the shielded wire has a higher capacity but we're taking PICOfarads.
If the system operated with time critical signals measured in nanoseconds, we might
begin to have some concerns about feedline capacity . . . but this simply isn't the
case.<p> 

I'm mystified by the test procedure requiring that sparks jump a 1.5" gap
between coil towers . . . Klaus was fond of demonstrating killer sparks. His Multi
Spark Discharge (MSD) system demonstrator was awesome to behold in the booth at
OSH back in 1986. In may well be that this extra-ordinary performance truly helped
win races. But I keep going back to the product mission for the masses. 99.9% of you
don't race your airplanes. You want to use automotive plugs and get SLIGHTLY better
performance from your engine. I'm skeptical that a spark that jumps only an inch between
towers is critically different that one that jumps 1.5 inches . . . the gap in the
plugs is only 0.060" or so . . . yes, it's under pressure, but still . . .<p>

In the final analysis, I cannot claim credit for the original suggestion . . . several
readers had already done it and found no problems with it. Many more have done it since
and report no problems. Further, they found the shielded wire much easier to work
with.  All I did was put some hammer-n-tongs suggestions to their repeatable experiments
that demonstrated a valid substitution. In spite of Klaus' protestation I can find
no compelling science to support the notion that coax cable is much superior to shielded
wire in this application. However, there ARE modern, high temperature coax cables like
RG-400 that can be used . . . and I believe Klaus is now recommending this material instead
of RG-58. It's a step in the right direction but RG-400 is no easier to work with than
RG-58 in terms of installation.<p>

I just received an e-mail from another builder reporting problems with RG-58: <b><i>Bob,
A while back your site had a download for an alternate to the Lightspeed RG58 to
coil connection.  I have a Lightspeed installed per instructions (RG58) and today
found the center conductor insulation near the coil completely melted away.
At 65 hours I was surprised, but I knew what I was looking at (thank you for that).
I can understand the possible reasons for removing this download from your web site.
If you can, would you tell me if you think your method was a bad idea, or was it
removed for other reasons? </i></b><p>

This letter has prompted me to re-post the original article along with this narrative
on circumstances surrounding the original posting and subsequent kerfuffle. I'll leave
it up to builders to choose between (1) RG-400 coax cable which is made from much more
robust materials than RG-58 and (2) Tefzel insulated shielded wire which has been
successfully utilized in dozens of Lightspeed installations.<p>

As always, I'd appreciate any feedback readers can offer in their first-hand
experiences and observations in this matter. The best decisions and designs are
made on good data.<p>

Instructions for the popular and capable electronic ignition system from Lightspeed recommends
RG58 coaxial cable for wiring between the ignition control module and high tension
coils on the engine. In this writer's opinion, it's difficult to pick a wire less 
suited to this task. I base this opinion upon the types of materials
used for this venerable coax.<p>

RG58 has been around for nearly 60 years. It was a popular coaxial cable
in World-War II era aircraft. The insulation materials were the best we
had available at the time: polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene. Originally
designed for use in relatively low temperature areas, this wire was widely
specified into antenna feedline systems for airborne and ground communications.<p>

Six decades later, our operating frequencies of interest have gone up by at
least ten-fold. Modern insulations with names like teflon, tefzel, kevlar,
and kapton have been offered as having superior characteristics at radio
frequencies and much more robust characteristics with respect to abrasion
and environmental temperature.<p>

I'm not privy to details of why this now obsolete cable is recommended for
the ignition system wiring. I suspect it was to take advantage of the very
neat, low cost, easy to apply, bayonet locking BNC connectors designed for coaxial
cable termination. While RG58 mates up nicely with BNC style
connectors, use in the engine compartment is not recommended. Both
insulations used in fabricating RG58 are particularly susceptible to
ozone and heat induced deterioration. This wire was never intended for use
in proximity of engines.  A more modern coax like RG-400 could be considered
but allow me to suggest an low cost, very robust alternative to coaxial
transmission line in this application.</font><p>

Consider this modern 20AWG shielded wire. Here's a
wire I stock that features Teflon wrap over Kapton for the outer
insulation. I'm unsure about the inner insulation, it shrugs off the heat
of a soldering iron. I suspect it's Tefzel.<p>

Start by stripping back about 1.5" of outer insulation

position. Note that the end of the pin is just flush with the connector

shield grip sleeve down over rear of connector with tail of shield braid
inside and crimp with proper die of the tool.<p>

Since this connector was NOT designed for use with undersized, fake-coax
it's a good idea to support the installed connector wire-up and drip
5-minute epoxy into the back. Put a drop in place and "stir" it down
by wiggling the wire. When the epoxy has completely enveloped the circumference
of the wire, you can suck on the connector to pull epoxy inside. Keep
adding drops of epoxy and combinations of wiggle-and-suck until you are assured
of center conductor retention.<p>

It's not necessary to totally fill the void with epoxy. We're only making
sure that a tug on the wire doesn't jerk the center conductor out of its
proper resting place in the connector.

<center><h2>Step 7</h2><p></center>
<font size="5"><a href=RG58_Not7.jpg>Click Here </a> for larger image. 
Instructions that come with the LSE system suggest that you do not use
heat-shrink on any of the finished joints for RG58 . . . this is because
materials used will melt at even the ordinary temperatures used to apply
heat-shrink . . . there is risk of displacing enough center conductor insulation
that the wire shorts out to the shield. Given that there is no such risk with
this wire, a heat-shrink segment over the joint adds bend support to the
finished connector installation.

<font size="5"><a href=RG58_Not10.jpg>Click Here </a> for larger image. I understand
the attraction of RG-58/BNC combinations. Years ago I used RG58 as signal cables
in data acquisition systems for accident analysis. We worked a lot with the cast-iron
and diesel fuel environment of railroads. The RG58 was relatively inexpensive.
A pulled-off or stepped-on BNC connector could be easily and quickly replaced in
the field. Custom length data cables were quickly fabricated. I didn't carry
RG58 spools on the airline . . . I just bought a spool at the local Radio Shack
when I got there. A crimp tool and a few dozen loose connectors made sure that
if we had any problems with data gathering, it WASN'T going be be caused by sensor
cables.<p>

These cables were EXPECTED to receive damage and if a full set of cables
lasted only one job, the convenience and time savings made them good value
for the task. However, for wiring Klaus' fine ignition system
we'd like to see the wiring go in easy, be well rated to the environment
and last a very long time with no maintenance. If it were my airplane, it
would be wired as described above . . .
