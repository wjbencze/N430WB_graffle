    <font face="Arial"><p><strong>One day this expert was speaking to a group of business

    students and, to drive home a point, used an illustration those students will never

    forget. </strong></p>

    <p><strong>As this man stood in front of the group of high-powered over achievers he said,

    &quot;Okay, time for a quiz.&quot; Then he pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouthed mason jar

    and set it on a table in front of him. Then he produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and

    carefully placed them, one at a time, into the jar. </strong></p>

    <p><strong>When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he

    asked, &quot;Is this jar full?&quot; Everyone in the class said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then he

    said, &quot;Really?&quot; He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel.

    Then he dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work

    themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks. Then he asked the group once more,

    &quot;Is the jar full?&quot; By this time the class was on to him. &quot;Probably

    not,&quot; one of them answered.&nbsp; &quot;Good!&quot; he replied. He reached under the

    table and brought out a bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in and it went into

    all the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once more he asked thequestion,

    &quot;Is this jar full?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; the class shouted. Once again he said,

    &nbsp; &quot;Good!&quot; Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in until

    the jar was filled to the brim. </strong></p>

    <p><strong>Then he looked up at the class and asked, &quot;What is the point of this

    illustration?&quot; One eager beaver raised his hand and said, &quot;The point is, no

    matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard, you can always fit some more

    things into it!&quot; &quot;No,&quot; the speaker replied, &quot;that's not the point. </strong></p>

    <p><strong>The truth this illustration teaches us is: If you don't put the big rocks in

    first, you'll never get them in at all.&quot; </strong></p>

    <p><strong>What are the 'big rocks' in your life? A project that YOU want to accomplish?

    Time with your loved ones? Your education, your finances? A cause? Teaching or

    mentoring others? If you sweat the little stuff then you'll fill your life with little 

    things you worry about that don't really matter, and you'll never have the time to spend 
    
    on the important stuff. Remember to put the big rocks in first or you'll never get 

    them in at all. 

    <P>--- So,&nbsp; tonight or in the morning when you are reflecting on this short story,

    ask yourself this question: What are the 'big rocks' in my life or business? Then, put

    those in your jar first.</strong></font></td>
