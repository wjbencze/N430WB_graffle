	   <b>Alternator Ouput versus Shaft Speed:</b> We know that an alternator's
	   output is zero when the shaft is not turning. When does an alternator
	   begin to produce useful power? The above is an exemplar
	   alternator power output performance curve. Note that this alternator just
	   starts to deliver power at about 1000 RPM.<p>

	   Of course, an alternator begins to generate some voltage as soon as it starts
	   to rotate . . . but for our purposes, any voltage less than the regulation
	   setpoint value is not useful. This alternator just produces regulated output
	   at 1000 RPM . . . The available current is still zero. This is called <b><I>"minimum
	   speed for regulation"</i></b>.  At just above 1000 RPM, power available to
	   do work just begins. As speed increases, output increases until at about
	   5500 RPM, the curve stops rising. This happens at <b><I>"minimum speed for full output"</i></b>.

	   <b>Minimum Speed for Regulation:</b>  Let's assume that the bus is hot, the
	   alternator switch is ON, and alternator RPM is zero. The voltage regulator says
	   the bus voltage is too low and applies full bus voltage to the field but with
	   no result. No horsepower in; no watts out.  Since the field winding has full bus
	   voltage applied, the under-speed alternator will behave just as if it had
	   a permanent magnet for a field. There is immediate potential for output
	   voltage developed in the alternator's stator windings as soon as the
	   alternator RPM increases from zero. However. until the regulator senses that
	   the voltage has reached regulation setpoint, the alternator will be fully
	   fielded and output voltage will be roughly proportional to RPM.<p>
	   
	   As soon as alternator speed is sufficient to produce regulator setpoint
	   output, the regulator will begin to reduce field voltage in response to
	   changes in RPM and/or load such that output voltage is constant at the regulator's
	   setpoint voltage. If you increase speed without adding load, the field voltage
	   gets lower and lower.  At minimum speed for full output but with no load, the
	   field voltage on a 14v alternator may very well be LESS THAN one volt!
