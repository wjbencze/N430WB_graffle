	   <b>Torque and RPM as it relates to Horsepower:</b> We know that any
	   alternator bolted to an engine takes power to make it operate. Unlike our
	   ponies that exert a force by pulling, engines put out power by turning
	   a shaft. In this case, the force is measured as a torque value (some force
	   acting through some lever arm or radius) and a speed (revolutions per
	   some time interval.<p>
	   
	   With a little pencil work, one can easily deduce that one horsepower
	   delivered by spinning a shaft is equal to speed x force divided by
	   some constant. In the case of speed in RPM and Force in Pound-Inches, the
	   constant is 63,024 as illustrated in the formula to the right.

	   <b>Power Output:</b> Okay, we're going to put horsepower
	   into an alternator, what do we want out? We'll, it would be really nice if the
	   alternator's output voltage were accurately controlled for the maintenance of
	   a lead-acid battery (14.2 +/- 0.4 volts) and delivered with enough current to power
	   all the ship's electro-whizzies and still accomplish a timely re-charge of
	   a heavily discharged battery.<p>
	   
	   14-Volt, 40-Amp machines are very popular for a large number of light aircraft.
	   Power available from this machine is 14V times 40A yields 560 Watts ouput
	   for the purpose of doing work in the electrical system.

       <td><b>Efficiency:</b> We're going to put horsepower in one end of
	   this gizmo and get Watts out the other end. At some point in time we're
	   going to be interested in how <b><i>efficient</i></b> the alternator is.
	   The efficiency affects two important design aspects of an alternator
	   installation. The most obvious is, (1) how much of the engine's total output
	   power is needed to supply alternator demands. The less obvious fact asserts that
	   (2) alternators toss off most of their losses in heat. It may be that
	   the machine will benefit from some consideration for cooling.<p>
	   
	   Efficiency is defined as OUTPUT power divided by INPUT power times 100
	   to yield a percentage. My math teachers wouldn't let me divide H.P. by
	   WATTS so we'll exploit a conversion deduced by some clever
	   folks a long time ago. One H.P. is the mechanical equivalent of 746 electrical
	   watts. In many venues, suppliers of engines speak of their product's capability
	   to deliver power in terms of watts or kilowatts instead of horsepower. To
	   get horsepower, divide watts by 746.<p>
	   
	   Let us assume our hypothetical 14v/40A alternator has an average efficiency
	   of 65%. This means that for 560 Watts of output, we'll need to provide
	   560 /.65 = 862 watts of input. Dividing 860 watts by 746 yields 1.15
	   horsepower.
