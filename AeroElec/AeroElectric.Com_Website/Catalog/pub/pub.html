<b>Reader Feedback:</b><p>
I do electrical designs for a living and I learned a LOT from this book.  If
you are planning to wire your own airplane then you MUST buy this book.  At
$33.00 it is a wash compared to all the grief that you will save.<p>

Besides, Bob spends a bunch of time on the AeroElectric list answering our
questions and asks nothing in return.  Go buy the book.<p>

I'm in the process of building a Lancair ES and I'm about 90% done. Over the
course of building I have had the experience to read a great deal of information
(books, manuals, magazines etc.) on how to get the job done. I wanted to let
you know that your AeroElectric Connection was an excellent document and was
without question some of the best money I have spent on any of the airplane
requirements. I hope that you will continue with your excellent work.<p>

Received electronic version from Builders Books. I am pleased beyond expectation!<p>

I really like the full spectrum treatment. The historical perspectives are excellent.
Very nice reading as well as technical reference.<p>

I've joined your list and I managed to pick up an originally packed Turbo
CAD version 12 here in Germany for a rather reasonable price from Amazon.
Ebay offerings in the states didn't offer an option for overseas shipping.
I can't wait to get your CD and get stuck in to the electrics of my project.
I've just been burning the midnight oil reading the FAQ's I downloaded
from your website.<p>


Even though I fly the electronically highly complex Airbus A319/320/321
for a living, I find that there is an enormous amount to be learned from your
website. I salute you and thank you once again for the great service you
are providing to the homebuilding community. You have certainly deserved
your guru status when it comes to taming electrons and putting them
to useful work in our homebuilt aircraft. Keep up the good work!<p>

<STRONG>P/N <FONT COLOR=Red>AEC_R12A</FONT> 12th Revision to the AeroElectric Connection</STRONG><br>
<p>
<FONT COLOR=purple>Since it's inception the AeroElectric Connection was offered
as a loose-leaf document for 3-ring binder. This method of printing is becoming
too expensive. Beginning with the 12th edition, the 'Connection is
now a perfect bound, paper-back book. If you'd like to convert your book to 3-ring binder, most
print shops can shear off the binding and 3-hole drill your stack of loose pages
for a nominal fee.
